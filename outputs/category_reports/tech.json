      "content": "Tech / Command Line The AI spending frenzy is just getting started Project Stargate kicks off a fresh wave of tech CEO chest-thumping. Plus: My conversation with the CEO of Reddit. byAlex Heath Jan 25, 2025, 12:15 AM UTC Digital photo collage of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, Oracle CTO Larry Ellison (R), and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son (2nd-R). Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images Alex Heath Alex Heathis a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has been reporting on the tech industry for more than a decade. “All I know is I’m good for my $80 billion.” Rarely does a one-liner so perfectly capture the state of the moment. Here, you have Microsoft CEO Satya Nadellasaying he’s “not in the details” about Stargate, the supposedly multi-hundred-billion AI infrastructure project driven by his marquee investment, OpenAI. Nadella not being read in on the nebulous details of Stargate says a lot about how much Microsoft and OpenAI have drifted apart. Microsoft is mentioned in the Stargate press release since OpenAI’s models are still exclusive to Azure. But the most striking aspect of Stargate is not that the money isn’t there for it yet; it’s that OpenAI’s biggest backer has decided to not participate in what Sam Altman is calling “the most important project of this era.” As Nadella made clear on CNBC this week, he’s running his own, $80 billion AI infrastructure buildout and, going forward, OpenAI can get additional compute — with his blessing — elsewhere. While it received fewer headlines this week, I found Nadella’s response to Elon Musk on X even more illuminating. In his response to Musk saying, “on the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money,” Nadella responded: “😂 And all this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” That post can only be interpreted as a dig at Altman. Nadella could have funded Stargate for OpenAI. He didn’t. What does he know that the rest of us don’t? The splashy Stargate unveiling at the White House certainly accomplished its goal, which was clearly getting everyone to talk about big numbers. The headlines it generated prompted Mark Zuckerbergto make sure everyone ended the week knowing his data center will be even bigger than Stargate. In a Friday post on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said that Meta’s planned 2GW data center in Louisiana “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” with a map view of the square footage overlaid on the city to send the point home. From his post (my emphasis added): “We’ll bring online ~1GW of compute in ‘25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.” I have no doubt that Altman, Masayoshi Son, and Larry Ellison will be able to raise the billions they need to lessen OpenAI’s dependence on Microsoft for compute. (The US government isn’t giving money to Stargate, which makes the optics of announcing it alongside Trump all the more bizarre.) Ultimately, this all points to the theme that is quickly coming to define 2025: Big Tech sees AI as the most existential technology of the coming era and will keep spending like hell to make sure OpenAI doesn’t completely run away with it. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman Steve Huffman,Illustration by William Joel / The Verge | Photo by Greg Doherty/Variety via Getty Images AMA with spez Few companies had as good of a 2024 as Reddit. Since going public last March, the company’s stock has soared 300 percent, giving the social network a valuation of $32 billion. It’s an about-face from where Reddit was before going public, when its moderators were raging against its hurried platform changes and there was backlash to the company selling its data to Google and OpenAI. With those controversies now seemingly in the rear-view mirror, Reddit is focused on growing its user base, staying profitable, and using AI to help people search its site more easily. I caught up with CEO Steve Huffman at CES a few weeks ago to hear his priorities for 2025, how he’s leading Reddit, his thoughts on the AI scaling debate, content moderation, and more… The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: Your IPO did very well. What have the last nine months or so been like for you personally? We have a saying at Reddit that good numbers make good meetings. So we’ve had some good meetings. Preparing to go public was intense. It’s telling the story over and over and over, which I enjoy doing, but it’s a lot of work. I think more than most new companies, we are in the public company rhythm already: close the quarter, do the audits, do the board meeting, earnings, and all of that. So it hasn’t been a major change for us from an operating point of view. It’s a really exciting time for the new investors and employees. You won’t catch us complaining. What I keep telling the company is that everyone should be very proud of the work they’ve done and don’t take these moments for granted. I just tell them, look, enjoy the view. If you look at our history, there are lots of ups and downs. No doubt there are challenges in our future. With your market cap where it is now, are you thinking of making swings you didn’t think you could make a year ago? There are two classes of things that we would do. One is to execute the core strategy. We’ve got to hire. We’ve got to build. I think we’re very reasonable in terms of our investment size. The one sentence strategy for us is to grow the product and stay profitable. What can you do with a high stock price? Maybe you can look at M&A that you wouldn’t otherwise. I’d say that’s not really our orientation right now because the acquisitions we’ve done over the last two years have been these 25-to-50-million-dollar deals. It’s kind of a sweet spot for us to get tech and teams. I’d say we’re always watching the market, but we’re not pursuing anything big or crazy right now because I like the core strategy. I think we can do what we want to do within our current capabilities. What’s the main product focus for Reddit this year? The first is the core of Reddit, which is community conversations. Everyone has a home on Reddit, but do you see that home in your first session? There’s a whole other dimension to our work, which is Reddit as an information source. Reddit has all of this incredible information. For the users who have a question that needs an answer, can we give them that answer? We just got into testing Reddit Answers. I’m finding that really helpful for searches about current events. A year from now, it’s a monetization product. It’s one of the few products where it kind of scratches every itch, so it’ll be a big focus. What do you make of this debate about whether the AI industry has run out of data? I think we’d have a different answer to that question literally every month. We want to have good relationships with other people in this space. We’re open for business. At the same time, we want to maximize the value we get out of our own data. We have not experienced conflict between the two at this point. I love the [data licensing] relationships we have — the major ones being Google and OpenAI. At this point, we don’t need to make any particular partnership. I’d say they’re all nice to have but nothing is existential for us. One of the challenges is that the AI companies don’t know what product they’re building. It’s not a bad thing. They are iterating themselves. ChatGPT itself, the central product in this conversation, was a demo. Then, a year later, it’s the most important piece of enterprise technology on Earth with questionable economics. That makes it very exciting. I don’t think any of these companies would be offended to hear me say that. You were one of the first social media CEOs I saw to be very critical of TikTok. How does a US ban affect Reddit? If you look at Reddit’s traffic graph over the last 19 years, you will not see the rise and fall of any particular platform. I think every content type should work on Reddit. Video on Reddit is largely camera-out — what I’m looking at — as opposed to camera-in, or who am I? That’s social media. I think the ban is the right thing to do for reasons I’ve mentioned that honestly have nothing to do with competition. With Meta’s moderation changes, the broader conversation around social media feels like it’s changing right now. For the last 10 years, people have been talking about whether speech is the problem, which is a crazy thought. You can’t have freedom without speech. I think that detour through questioning and relitigating core values of America, hopefully that era is coming to a close. Are people playing politics? Of course, people always are. On the topic of moderation, we always just try to do things the right way, which, not coincidentally, are aligned with American values. It’s a democratic platform. We believe very much in the power of people and the wisdom of crowds and voting processes. That is Reddit. So I’m glad to see a return to where we have been most of my life, which is an appreciation for free speech.",

The app disappeared from both Apple and Google’s stores January 19, 2025, as a nationwide ban took effect. Briefly. What will ultimately happen to TikTok remains unclear.

The biggest tech stories you missed Avowed review: Elder Scrolls? I don’t know her Gemini Advanced can now recall your past conversations to inform its responses The OnePlus Open 2 isn't happening this year Apple will introduce its ‘newest member of the family’ next week On February 19, maybe a new iPhone SE and a 2nd-gen AirTag. TMA Apple In a tweet on Thursday, CEO Tim Cook told Apple aficionados to “get ready to meet the newest member of the family. ”What that product is remains a slight mystery, though we won’t have to wait too long to find out. The reveal will take place on Wednesday, February 19. While we’ve focused on a next-gen iPhone SE, Cook’s tweet also featured an animated image of a shimmering Apple logo on what appears to be the outline of an AirTag. There have been rumors for a while that Apple would introduce a second-gen tracker sometime this year. Also: AirTags have changed my life. Or at least stopped me getting locked out of my apartment multiple times in the last few years. It’ll be intriguing to see what else a tracker can offer. Please don’t make it AI. Continue reading. Honda and Nissan have ended their merger plans No Honsan. No Ninda. The tech love story of 2025 is over. Honda and Nissan have ended merger plans. If they’d gone through with it and also brought Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi on board, the new entity would’ve had a net worth of around $50 billion. The Financial Times reported in early February that Honda presented a new company structure that would make Nissan its subsidiary as a “take it or leave it” offer. Nissan decided to leave it.

Thanks to all the early question-askers (hit me up on askmat(at)engadget.com), including a timely question in the face of new Apple hardware. From Matt Ali: What’s the cheapest way to get an iPad? And which one should I get in early 2025? Instead of doing my own research or asking unhinged AI chatbots, I tapped our iPad expert (and reviewer), Nathan Ingraham, for an answer: TMA Engadget “Apple hardware is known for being expensive, but the company has a store packed with high-quality refurbished products that can save you some serious cash. I’ve bought many devices there over the years and have never had a problem — everything is in like-new condition and has the same warranty as a brand-new product.” At the time of writing, there are a few good options in Apple’s refurbished store if you want an iPad nearly as capable as the newest models but want to save some cash. If you want the largest screen possible, you can grab a sixth-generation, 12.9-inch iPad Pro with an M2 chip and 256GB of storage for $979. Considering the latest 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1299, this merits consideration — especially if you’re an artist who wants a large canvas. If you don’t need that large screen, consider the fifth-generation iPad Air. For $529, you’ll get an 11-inch display, M1 chip and 256GB of storage. That’s $170 less than the current M2 iPad Air with the same amount of storage. Apple’s standard iPad is also available refurbished, but you can often find a brand-new version of it on sale on Amazon. Between that and the rumors of a new basic iPad coming this spring, I’d avoid this one, for now. If you want to upgrade the storage or get a model with cellular connectivity, that should also be doable for extra cash. For me, 256GB or 512GB is the sweet spot for storage — given the ubiquity of the cloud, having a ton of local storage doesn’t feel particularly necessary. Similarly, cellular connectivity is probably not worth the extra cash unless you plan to travel with your iPad. Most of the time, you can easily tether an iPad to your phone if you need to get online quickly. But, those refurb options are available if you want them.” Thanks Nate! Other tech dilemmas?

Deals The best President's Day tech deals on Apple, Samsung, Dyson, Blink and more We scoured the web to find the best President's Day sales on the tech we recommend. Amy Skorheim amy skorheim Senior Reporter, Buying Advice Sat, Feb 15, 2025, 6:00 AM PST Billy Steele/Engadget Presidents’ Day typically brings discounts on mattresses and appliances more so than consumer tech. But every year, there are a few standouts in the areas Engadget knows best like smartphones, tablets, earbuds and more. This year is no different; notably, Presidents' Day deals include $50 off an annual subscription to Peacock Premium, and get the best price on the AirPods Pro 2 that we’ve seen since the holidays last year. If you want to get a jump-start on spring cleaning, iRobot and Dyson deals can help with that, and there are a number of discounts on Blink security cameras at the moment. These are the best Presidents’ Day deals we found on tech for 2025. Spotlight President's Day deal Image for the large product moduleBilly Steele for Engadget Apple AirPods Pro 2 $169$249Save $80 Everyone's favorite buds (seriously, people buy a lot of these things) fell to a record low of $154 for Black Friday, but this is the best price we've seen this year. They're a little older at this point, debuting in 2022, but they're still our favorite wireless earbuds for iPhone. Engadget's Billy Steele gave them a score of 88 in his review when the buds first came out, citing the fantastic sound and amazing transparency mode. $169 at Amazon The best President's Day tech deals A tablet resting against books. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad mini for $499 at Amazon ($100 off): Apple’s smallest tablet was updated in October and got a new A17 Pro chip, which Engadget's Nathan Ingraham found to be plenty fast for anything you'd want to do with the mini — casual browsing, couch binging, game playing and email checking. He gave it an overall score of 83 in our official review and particularly enjoyed it as a Balatro machine. It's also our favorite (partly because it's the only) small iPad on our list of the best iPads. Apple AirPods 4 for $100 at Amazon ($29 off): Apple's newest wireless earbuds came out in September and last week, they hit their lowest price yet. That price is still going strong, so you can still pick them up at a discount. Engadget's Billy Steele gave them a review score of 88, saying they sounded clearer and more balanced than most open-back earbuds. Plus you get all the Apple-perks like fast pairing and device switching with other Apple gadgets, hands-free Siri and Find My tracking. Also at Target and Best Buy. There's also a noise-canceling version on sale for $149. Apple MacBook Pro (2024) Desk View on macOS Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple 2024 MacBook Pro M4 for $1400 at Amazon ($199 off with coupon): Apple's latest Pro-model laptop is down to $1,400 at Amazon with a discount and an on-page coupon. The 14-inch MacBook Pro has 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD storage and both the Space Black and Silver colorways are on sale. Engadget's Devindra Hardawar gave the computer a 92 in his review and it's currently Engadget's pick for the best MacBook for creatives. It has a fast M4 chip, long battery life, bright display and Sharp 12MP Center Stage webcam. Apple Studio Display with tilt-adjustable stand for $1,300 at Amazon ($300 off): We appreciated the excellent build quality of Apple's pricey display in our official review, but noted that it's probably only for Apple diehards. Both the standard glass model and the nano-textured glass option are on sale. The Studio Display made our list of the best monitors and has built-in speakers, a 12MP camera, three USB-C ports and a screen with 5K resolution — but a max refresh rate of 60Hz and single-zone backlighting. Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 at Walmart ($10 off): Apple sells too many versions of the Apple Pencil. So we made a guide. The USB-C model works with all current-generation iPads, including the M2 iPad Air, the M4 iPad Pro, the new iPad mini and the 10th generation iPad. It'll also work with a few older tablets too. Just note that this one attahced magnetically but doesn't recharge that way, like the other Apple Pencils. And it doesn't have pressure sensitivity. Also at Amazon and Target. A logo. Peacock Peacock Premium (one-year) at Peacock for $30 ($50 off): Here's one from our new streaming deals guide: A year of Peacock's streaming service is $30 if you use the code WINTERSAVINGS at checkout. The code is valid through February 18 and saves you 60 percent off the usual $80 annual fee. Though it's called \"Premium\" it's actually the ad-supported tier (Premium Plus is the ad-free plan but it's not discounted and goes for $140 yearly). Peacock is one of our picks for the best streaming services and has some great original content, including Poker Face, a Twisted Metal adaptation and Mrs. Davis. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16 GB) for $135 at Amazon ($25 off): Our choice for best premium ereader. is the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition that goes for $200 and isn't discounted. The standard Paperwhite, on sale here, is basically the same machine, minus a few (inessential) perks like auto-adjusting front lights, extra storage and wireless charging. This is the lowest price we've tracked this year (it went about $5 lower for Black Friday) on a very lovely e-reader with remarkably fast page turns, a super crisp display and a great battery life. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition (32 GB) for $230 at Amazon ($50 off): Engadget's Valentina Palladino found a lot to like about the Kindle Colorsoft in her review including quick page turns, the fairly accurate (if a bit cold) color technology and the pinch to zoom feature, which was especially nice for reading comics. If you're just looking to read black and white text, you can save yourself a bit of money and go with the Paperwhite — text on the Colorsoft is not as crisp. KitchenAid Artisan Series 5 quart tilt head stand mixer for $350 at Amazon ($100 off): One of our top picks for kitchen tech is, unsurprisingly, KitchenAid's famed stand mixer. It's not only powerful, the seemingly endless array of available attachments make it a true kitchen multitasker. KitchenAid is hosting a larger sale for President's Day on its own website, and many of the brand's countertop appliances are currently up to $100 off. iRobot Roomba Combo 10 Max for $789 at Wellbots ($610 off with code): Wellbots has a few iRobot vacuums on sale for President's Day, including the new Roomba Combo 10 Max and its Autowash Dock, which can empty and cleans the vac. Right now it's on sale for $789 if you use the code ENGAD410 at checkout. That'll take a full $610 off the hefty $1,399 MSRP. That's even cheaper than the last time it was on sale. Not only does the robot itself mop and vacuum, the dock can hold 60 days worth of dust and seven days worth of dirty mop water. For a slightly cheaper combo robo vac, Wellbots is also discounting the Roomba Combo j5 for $239 instead of the full $529 with the code ENGAD210. Dyson V12 vaccuum for $499 at Dyson ($150 off): Now through President's Day, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim stick vacuum is $150 off. This is the lighter sibling to the V15 model we picked as the best cordless vac in our guide. This one includes the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that won us over in our testing. It's a hard-floor brush head with a laser \"blade\" that clearly shows you the tiniest bits of dust so you can be sure to suck them up. The Gen5 Outsize Absolute is also on sale for $150 off. It's down to $899. That model is the largest cordless vac and has up to 140 minutes of run time. Samsung Music Frame Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Samsung LS60D Music Frame for $150 at Woot ($250 off): You might be familiar with Samsung's Frame TV — the sets that mimic works of art when you're not watching television. The Music Frame furthers that home-theater-as-decor aesthetic by hiding Dolby Atmos audio equipment behind what looks like a regular picture frame. This one doesn't have a screen, instead you'll insert your own photo or art behind the glass. Inside are two woofers, two tweeters and two mid-range drivers. The speaker array is capable of Dolby Atmos audio and it leverages Samsung's SpaceFit tech to calibrate the sound to the room. We checked it out at CES 2024 and were impressed with how robust the music sounded. Fitbit Charge 6 Fitness Tracker for $116 at Amazon ($44 off): Our current top pick for a fitness tracker is back on sale. It went as low as $100 for Black Friday, but this is the lowest price we've seen this year. Our favorite fitness tracker is the successor to our previous top pick, the Charge 5. This new generation has a more accurate heart rate monitor and the ability to pair with exercise machines via Bluetooth. Plus there's now a physical side button for navigation in addition to the touchscreen. Mill food recycler for $874 at Mill ($125 off): A President's Day sale from Mill, the kitchen food recycling company, will run until Monday, February 17 and will give you $125 off a new food recycling bin. If you've explored the different options for composting food and have decided to give a machine a try, Mill could be a good one to check out. The machine dries and grinds food scraps, reducing odors and bulk while creating grounds that you can add to your garden. A person uses an 8BitDo Pro2 controller to play a game on a Nintendo Switch.~ 8BitDo 8BitDo Pro 2 controller for $39 at Amazon ($12 off): The black version of one of our picks for the best Switch controllers is down to a record-low price. The programmable controller is compatible with the Switch, Apple devices, Android devices, Windows PC, Steam Deck and Raspberry Pi. Blink Mini 2 (2-pack) for $38 at Amazon ($32 off): The Blink Mini 2 security camera sell for $40 each at full price, so this deal gets you two for less than the MSRP for one. The small security cameras have two way talk and listen, capture live video in 1080p and have infrared sensors for black and white images at night. You'll need a Blink Subscription Plan if you want to save clips to the cloud, but if you also buy a Sync Module 2, you can save clips from your Blink Mini cameras to a flash drive. Blink Video Doorbell and Sync Module 2 for $35 ($35 off): Here's a bundle that combines the Video Doorbell with a Sync Module 2, the device that allows you to store footage from your Blink cameras and doorbells locally. The doorbell offers 1080p daytime footage and infrared night video plus two-way audio. You can use it wired or on batteries that should last two years before needing to be replaced. The Blink subscription plan is required if you want person detection and the ability to store clips in the cloud. Ring Battery Video Doorbell for $60 at Amazon ($40 off): Another Amazon security device company, Ring, is also having a sale right now. The discount matches the record-low price for the Ring Video Doorbell. This battery-powered model doesn't need to be wired into your home, so you can put it near any door. The removable battery is rechargeable via USB-C and will likely need a refill every couple months. You'll need a Ring subscription to access all the features, like person and package alerts and extended event history. Apple Music logo on a red background Apple Apple Music (6 months) for $3 at Apple ($60 off): Normally an Apple Music subscription is $11 per month after a 30-day free trial. And when you buy a new Apple device, you usually get a three-month trial. But if you somehow haven't yet signed up for the service, this promotion applies to you. The deal will run through February 27 and is open only to people who are entirely new Apple Music — current and previous customers are not eligible, nor are those who qualify for the free trial that comes with a new device. You'll need to redeem the offer through an iPhone, iPad or Mac. Apple Music made our guide to the best music streaming services for its lossless streaming quality, ease of use with Apple devices and emphasis on using DJ curation over AI and algorithm playlists. Note that the subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel. NordPass Premium (27 months) for $35 at Nord ($46 off): One of our favorite password managers for cross-platform availability is having a sale. NordPass Premium is currently available for $35 for 27 months. At full price, two years would cost you $81, and this deal throws in three months for free. NordPass also offers a free tier, but the Premium plan keeps you logged in when you switch devices while also helping you analyze your passwords to improve their strength. EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra for $5,299 at EcoFlow ($797 off): The whole-home backup battery and inverter from EcoFlow is on sale for a Valentine's Day/President's Day sale at the manufacturer's site. Samsung Evo Select (1TB) microSD card for $70 at Amazon ($10 off): The Evo Select is the budget pick in our guide to the best microSD cards: It's not the fastest model we tested, but it'll serve as a way to add storage for your Nintendo Switch or Android tablet. This deal matches the all-time low for the extra-spacious 1TB model. Also at Samsung and B&H. iRobot Roomba Vac Robot Vacuum (Q0120). Roomba iRobot Roomba Vac Essential (Q0120) for $119 at Amazon ($130 off): The top pick in our guide to the best budget robot vacuums has hit a new low price. It can't map paths in your home, instead it randomly traverses a room until it's covered the area. But it has good suction and cleans well, plus it's easy to set up and control through Roomba's mobile app. Also at Best Buy and Target. LG B4 OLED TV (48\") for $600 at Best Buy ($200 off): This ties the lowest price we've seen for the 48-inch LG B4, which is the entry-level model in LG's 2024 OLED lineup. While it's not as bright or color-rich as some higher-end alternatives, it still offers the essential perks of any good OLED TV: superb contrast with deep black tones, clear motion, wide viewing angles and the like. It's also a nice value for gaming, as it has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support refresh rates up to 120Hz. It's just better off in a darker room, and this particular model is relatively small.

Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesDAAPrivacyRightIcon CA Privacy Notice About Our Ads Social Media TikTok is back in Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the US The app was de-listed on January 19, as a nationwide ban briefly went into effect. Karissa Bell karissa bell Senior Editor Updated Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 6:11 PM PST·1 min read 1 NurPhoto via Getty Images TikTok is once again available in Apple’s App Store and Google's Play Store in the United States. The app disappeared from both Apple and Google’s stores January 19, 2025, as a nationwide ban briefly took effect. But though the app’s service was quickly restored after President Donald Trump promised not to enforce the ban, the app had remained unavailable for download in US app stores. Apple has now reversed course. Bloomberg reported the company made the decision after a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Trump previously told the Justice Department in an executive order to delay enforcing a ban for 75 days. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok is now also officially available in Google’s Play Store, after the company encouraged Android users to sideload the app. According to Axios, Google was assured by the Justice Department that restoring people's access to TikTok wouldn't violate the law. It’s still not clear what will ultimately happen to TikTok longterm. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to strike a “deal” that will allow the company to remain operational in the US, including arrangements that would give the US government a stake in the company. A number of investors and companies have also proposed offers to take over some aspect of TikTok, though the company hasn’t indicated which bids it might be taking seriously.

Lawrence Bonk lawrence bonk Contributing Reporter Wed, Feb 12, 2025, 12:00 PM PST·2 min read 1 Apple After years of waiting, the Apple TV app is finally available natively on Android devices. This version was “built from the ground up” to take advantage of the Android operating system and is currently ready for download from the Google Play Store. It was designed for smartphones, tablets and foldables. This is a full version of the app, with all of the stuff Apple users have come to expect. There’s a feature for picking up a show where you left off and a tool for downloading content to watch offline. It works via Wi-Fi or cellular. The app allows access to Apple TV+ content, so you can finally watch the absolute boatload of original shows the platform pumps out. It’s a veritable cornucopia of sci-fi goodness, with hit shows like Severance, Silo and For All Mankind. The platform also airs non-genre fare like Ted Lasso, Shrinking and Slow Horses. New users get a free seven-day trial to the platform. Otherwise, pricing is the same as always and folks can sign up for subscriptions via Google Play. The app even grants access to MLS Season Pass content, just in time for Major League Soccer’s 2025 season. Sports fans can also check out a weekly MLB double-header each Friday with no local restrictions. There have been workarounds to get Apple TV content on Android devices. In the past, users were forced to enter credentials via the web app or use a Prime Video bundle. Android TVs have long had a dedicated Apple TV app, but there was no way to subscribe on the television itself. That also changed today, as Google Play now offers the ability to subscribe on Android TVs. There’s no casting support on this first version of the app, but we hope it’ll come soon via a future update. The Apple TV app only works on devices running Android 10 or later.

Kris Holt kris holt Contributing Reporter Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:20 AM PST·1 min read 8 Reuters / Reuters It seems Apple is ready to show off something new. In a tweet on Thursday, CEO Tim Cook told Apple aficionados to \"get ready to meet the newest member of the family.\" What that product is remains a slight mystery, though we won't have to wait too long to find out what Apple has up its sleeve. The reveal will take place on Wednesday, February 19. In case there was any ambiguity, Cook's tweet included an #AppleLaunch hashtag. Cook's tweet also featured an animated image of a shimmering Apple logo on what appears to be the outline of an AirTag. It's been rumored for a while that Apple would introduce a second-gen tracker sometime this year. The purported AirTag 2 is expected to have a longer range and a speaker that's more difficult to remove, as well as Apple Vision Pro integration. In addition, reports suggest that Apple will reveal a new iPhone SE very soon. The unveiling was initially believed to be happening sometime this week. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said on Tuesday that the \"new iPhone SE is still imminent and should be announced by next week, when the company is holding product briefings.\" He added that an Apple Vision Pro announcement appears to be in the offing, while the M4-powered MacBook Air is slated to arrive \"within weeks.\" It seems that Apple has a lot of irons in the fire at the minute. As such, the company has a bunch of different options for what to reveal next week.

Mariella Moon mariella moon Contributing Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 11, 2025, 2:37 PM PST·2 min read 59 REUTERS / Reuters Google Maps now officially shows the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America if you open the app in the US. In a blog post, Google said it rolled out the named change because the government has already updated the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), which decides the \"federal and national standard for geographic nomenclature.\" One of the executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January when he took office renames the body of water, but Google previously explained that it's the company's longstanding policy to wait for official government resources to be updated before applying any name change. The Gulf of America label will only be visible if you use the Maps app in the US, or if you open Maps on the web and your device's location is set to the region. If you're in Mexico, the label still shows Gulf of Mexico. And if you're elsewhere, you'll see it marked as both, specifically: Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America). It's also longstanding policy for the company to show official local names when they vary between countries. Trump's executive order also renames Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. So far, the location is still being shown as Denali on Maps. Google Maps Google Separately, Apple updated its Maps application and website to include the new nomenclature for US users. At present, the company's map graphics still display \"Gulf of Mexico,\" but clicking on the region brings up a card that says \"Gulf of America.\" Searching for \"Gulf of Mexico\" brings up the same GoA card. According to Bloomberg, Apple won't limit this change to only the US. The news org, paraphrasing Apple, said that the company will \"soon roll out the shift for all users globally.\" We have reached out to Apple to confirm that users worldwide, including those in Mexico, will see Gulf of America on the company's maps. A Congressional Research Service report on how and where geographical name changes apply specifically says that \"private companies such as Google Maps and Apple Maps\" would be unaffected by President Trump's Executive Order. The report also notes that decisions from the US Board on Geographic Names, which was responsible for actioning the name change, only apply to federal use. Update, February 11, 5:35PM ET: This story and its headline were updated to reflect Apple's decision to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its Maps application. Additional context on geographical name changes from a Congressional Research Service report was also added.

Will Shanklin will shanklin Contributing Reporter Fri, Feb 14, 2025, 1:28 PM PST·1 min read Reddit / u/iron_cam86 Breaking: Netflix made an oopsie. On Thursday, word spread online that some of its content began appearing in the Apple TV app. The lack of an official announcement (and extremely buggy nature) of the integration was enough to cast doubt on the news. But that didn't stop users from rejoicing and sharing \"FINALLY!\" GIFs on social media. Unfortunately, your triumphant festivities weren't warranted, as the company has said it was unintentional. A Netflix spokesperson told The Verge on Friday that the Apple TV app integration was an error that has been rolled back. Indeed, Redditors who had been tracking the forbidden fruit with unbridled glee confirmed that all signs of Netflix content had since vanished from Apple's streaming hub. Netflix giveth, and Netflix taketh away. While the boo-boo was still active, PC World reported it let you add Netflix originals like Stranger Things, Cobra Kai and The Crown but lacked licensed shows and movies. Even the available content was a buggy mess. For example, only season five of The Crown was available, leaving you to wonder what hijinks Liz and the gang had gotten into before or after the grunge era. The \"Add to Watchlist\" and \"Continue Watching\" features were also said to be spotty. It's easy to speculate that such a glitch was tied to internal testing accidentally made public, but there's no reason to assume that's anything but wishful thinking. At least for now, you'll have to watch Netflix content in the Netflix app, leaving Apple’s for a well-earned rewatch of The Sopranos (via Max), The Bear (via Hulu) and Apple's own Silo.

Igor Bonifacic igor bonifacic Senior reporter Tue, Feb 11, 2025, 1:28 PM PST·1 min read REUTERS / Reuters Google has set the date for its next I/O developer conference. This year, the annual event will take place over two days starting on May 20, the company announced on Tuesday. As in previous years, the conference will feature an in-person component at the Shoreline Amphitheatre right on the company's doorstep in Mountain View, California. \"We’ll start day one with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities and more continuing on day two,\" Google said. In a separate email the company sent to Engadget, it promised to share updates on Gemini and Android, alongside new innovations related to web and cloud development. Last year's conference saw Google spend a lot of time talking about AI, including initiatives like Project Astra, and it's probably a safe bet to say I/O 2025 will be similar in that regard, with potential updates from DeepMind on Gemini 2.0, Project Mariner and more. Notably, this year I/O will overlap with Microsoft Build, which is set to run from May 19 to 22. Like I/O, Build is expected to include a major focus on AI.",

  "analysis": "Here is a Tech newsletter synthesizing the provided content while following the specified guidelines:\n\nTech Industry Heavyweights Warn of Existential AI Risk \n\nIn a striking show of unity, hundreds of scientists, academics, tech CEOs and public figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have signed a statement urging global attention on the potential existential risk posed by AI. The statement echoes the concerns raised in an open letter from tech bigwigs like Elon Musk in March, but goes further by explicitly mentioning the risk of \"extinction.\" This high-profile warning underscores the growing unease among AI pioneers about the unfettered development of this powerful technology.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI Relationship Frays as AI Infrastructure Race Heats Up\n\nThe uneasy alliance between Microsoft and OpenAI is showing signs of strain, as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella distances himself from OpenAI's ambitious \"Stargate\" infrastructure project. Nadella made it clear that Microsoft is focusing on its own $80B AI buildout and suggested OpenAI can seek additional compute resources elsewhere. His veiled dig at Altman's \"hype\" around AI highlights the growing competition and chest-thumping among tech CEOs as they pour billions into scaling up AI capabilities. OpenAI is now turning to other investors to fund Stargate and lessen its reliance on Microsoft.\n\nMeta and Others Ramp Up AI Spending and Hiring\n\nNot to be outdone, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta's planned 2GW data center in Louisiana would cover a significant part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring 1GW of compute online in 2025, ending the year with over 1.3M GPUs. The company is investing $60-65B in capital expenditures this year while significantly growing its AI teams. This frenetic AI spending and hiring points to 2025 being defined by Big Tech seeing AI as the most existential technology of the coming era. Companies are opening their wallets to avoid being left behind by OpenAI.\n\nIn Other News:\n\n- Apple's Alexa will no longer use celebrity voices for unspecified reasons\n- Qflow raises $9.1M for a unique way to track construction receipts and decarbonize projects  \n- Antimatter closes $2M to help students meme about topics they master\n- Tesla incorporates a questionable in-dash gaming feature with NHTSA blessing\n- Instacart lets you save preferred shoppers to be first alerted of future orders\n- A popular Android app began secretly spying on users months after Google Play listing\n\nThe AI arms race is kicking into high gear as tech giants sound alarm bells while also aggressively scaling up their own AI infrastructure and talent. 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year that will set the trajectory for this era-defining technology. The high stakes are leading to both unprecedented cooperation in the form of open letters and public statements, as well as intensifying competition in spending and innovation. All eyes will be on key players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google as they chart the future of AI - and potentially our own future as a species.",
