Giancarlo Romano, the alleged don of Sicily’s notorious Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was recently caught on wiretap complaining about the quality of new recruits, calling the young up-and-comers “miserable.” He grumbled that the organization currently has a fraction of the influence Vito Corleone had in The Godfather, which was based on Cosa Nostra. Just wait until he tries to bring them back to the office. —Sam Klebanov, Molly Liebergall, Matty Merritt, Abby Rubenstein, Neal Freyman MARKETS Nasdaq 20,026.77 +0.41% S&P 6,114.63 -0.01% Dow 44,546.08 -0.37% 10-Year 4.472% -5.0 bps Bitcoin $97,257.91 +0.80% Airbnb $161.42 +14.45% Data is provided by *Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 6:00pm ET. Here's what these numbers mean. Markets: Like most of us plan to do over the long weekend, stocks didn’t move much yesterday—though they did knock out a winning week. Airbnb had its best day ever after its Q4 earnings beat expectations, and its CEO laid out a vision for the company—whose cleaning fees you love to mock—to become the “Amazon” of travel. GOVERNMENT Trump puts defense cuts on the menu Defense Department Yasin Ozturk/Getty Images President Donald Trump said this week he’ll seek a nuclear weapons deal with US geopolitical foes China and Russia, and that he wants the trio to eventually agree to halve their military spending. Achieving such a trilateral agreement is a tall order, but that didn’t stop stocks of companies that supply Uncle Sam with the lethal machinery it uses to fight its adversaries from taking a nosedive at the suggestion. Shares in the largest US military contractor, Lockheed Martin, which got more than $68 billion in Pentagon business in 2023, dropped almost 5% since Trump’s remarks Thursday. Stocks of fellow defense dollar recipients RTX and Northrop Grumman plummeted 4% and 7%, respectively. But the Department of Defense—which is the federal government’s largest department, with an $800 billion budget—might start tightening its belt long before Trump pitches Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin on a military thriftiness pledge. DOGE is knocking at the Pentagon Trump has reportedly directed the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to scrutinize defense spending. Pentagon officials told NPR they expect DOGE to begin its work there in the coming days and that it’ll target an 8% spending cut. Defense Secretary Hegseth previously suggested that some top-ranking positions might be eliminated as the department reviews the 3 million people it employs in both uniformed and civilian roles. DOGE will also likely audit the equipment the military orders with some services reportedly already floating purchases to cut, per the Wall Street Journal. Lawmakers and experts of all political stripes have long criticized legacy weapons programs that are plagued with cost overruns and often yield tech of questionable usefulness—with Musk himself recently dunking on the uber-pricey F-35 jets. But slashing military costs could be politically tricky as defense contractors employ more than 2 million people across the country. Plus, Musk spearheading the effort presents a potential conflict of interest, as Space X is itself a Pentagon contractor. But not the entire weapons business stands to lose: Trump's Pentagon is expected to favor autonomous systems, which could benefit defense startups like the AI company Palantir and the dronemaker Anduril. Palantir shares rose over 6% this week.—SK Presented by Pacaso Top investors are buying this “unlisted” stock Pacaso When the team that co-founded Zillow and grew it into a $16b real estate leader starts a new company, investors notice.

WORLD Tour de headlines Elon Musk and Donald Trump in the Oval Office Jim Watson/Getty Images Thousands of federal workers laid off. On Thursday, one day after the Trump administration moved forward with its voluntary resignation program that 75,000 of the federal governments’ 2.3 million civilian workers signed up for, the administration began to lay off newer employees as part of its Elon Musk-led efforts to cut costs. The layoffs are expected to target most of the 200,000 probationary employees, who have usually been in their jobs for less than a year and do not have the same employment protections as longer standing government workers. Among those let go so far are: 1,000 Veterans Affairs staffers, 3,400 Forest Service employees, and 2,000 Energy Department workers, per the Wall Street Journal. TikTok is back in Apple and Google’s app stores. Apologies to anyone who planned to live large by selling their old TikTok-installed phone on eBay for $10k: Everyone’s favorite Chinese shortform video app and its siblings CapCut and Lemon8 are available for download again in Apple and Google’s US mobile app stores. The tech giants brought the ByteDance apps back on Thursday night after receiving assurances from US Attorney General Pam Bondi that the nationwide ban on TikTok wouldn’t be immediately enforced—meaning they won’t get hit with fines. Though President Trump halted the enforcement shortly after taking office, the ban still stands, and could kick in later if TikTok isn’t sold to an American company. DOJ moves to drop charges against NYC mayor after seven prosecutors resign in protest. The resignations from the Manhattan prosecutors’ office came after the Justice Department ordered them to drop bribery charges against Mayor Eric Adams. And in the kind of scorched earth resignation letter that most of us can only dream of sending, the case’s lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten told the DOJ, “I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.” Amid the rift between career prosecutors and the DOJ, a prosecutor did eventually sign the motion to dismiss that was filed yesterday…but reportedly only to spare colleagues from being fired over their refusal.—AR FOOD & BEV It’s not just eggs, your whole AM plate costs more Fried egg in cast iron pan with dollar sign yolk. Emily Parsons As if nothing is sacred anymore, collapsing into a cracked leather booth and securing a cheap breakfast feast is now at risk. Historically low-cost and popular breakfast staples like eggs, orange juice, and coffee have all seen price jumps, squeezing restaurants and consumers. It’s never a good time for your omelet to cost more, but the business of breakfast and brunch is booming. Yelp clocked 6,421 morning meal restaurants opening last year (up 23% from 2019), and even fast-food chains are beefing up their breakfast offerings. Why is your blue plate special so expensive? Roughly 159 million birds have been slaughtered because of the avian flu. In response, egg prices hit a record $4.95 per dozen last month. Citrus greening, a disease that destroys orange trees, has decimated groves in Florida, leading to some of the worst harvests in 90 years. The average cost of OJ concentrate in the supermarket has jumped nearly 90% since 2020. Poor growing conditions in Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s leading producers of coffee beans, caused beans to hit their highest price in 47 years last November. But people are still going out for breakfast. Foot traffic to restaurants during breakfast has leapt past other times since 2019, and pre-lunch visits accounted for 21% of all trips to restaurants in 2024, according to market research firm Circana as reported by the Associated Press.—MM together with Pacaso Pacaso Real estate disruptors target a $1.3t market.

HEALTH TECH What happens when your pet’s chipmaker goes dark vet scans dog for microchip Dardespot/Getty Images An animal microchip company has incurred the wrath of potentially thousands of Bichon Frisé households: Pet owners are scrambling to re-register their furry friends’ rice-sized implants after the pet-chip maker Save This Life abruptly shut down this week, rendering its microchips effectively useless without its database. Nobody’s answering calls or emails, according to concerned customers, chip distributors, competitors who were interested in buying Save This Life’s data, and even the American Animal Hospital Association, which runs the online registry for looking up a found animal’s chip number. Save This Life lost its business license last year, per Washington Post, possibly over tax payment issues. “Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands” of pets may have gotten Save This Life chips since its founding in 2012, Tom Sharp, president of an American Kennel Club-affiliated nonprofit, estimated. (Only 6 in 10 microchips actually get registered, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.) What to do if you think your baby has this chip: Don’t panic. Veterinary clinics and hospitals that use Save This Life are alerting customers and urging them to re-register their pets with one of the other 40+ microchip companies in the US. You can also check your pet yourself—Save This Life chips start with either 991 or 900164.—ML STAT Prime number: Shopping is dropping A woman holding shopping bags looks in a window Sean Justice/Getty Images If your favorite store clerk isn’t smiling quite as widely as usual when they greet you today, it could be because data released yesterday showed that US retail sales experienced their biggest decline in nearly two years last month. Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January, marking the steepest monthly decrease since March 2023, according to the Commerce Department. The big dip came on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in December, the department said. Why aren’t Americans giving into their inner shopaholic any more? Part of the reason could simply be seasonality as everyone comes down from their holiday-buying binge. Plus, the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and severe winter storms hitting large swaths of the country might have made getting out to brick-and-mortar stores harder than usual. But with sales going down across nine of the 13 categories tracked—motor vehicles, sporting goods, and furniture fell the most—Bloomberg notes that it could be driven by more than just bad weather as consumers continue to contend with high inflation, which could be a worrying sign for the economy.—AR NEWS What else is brewing OpenAI’s board unanimously rejected Elon Musk’s unsolicited $97.4 billion offer to buy the ChatGPT-maker, saying the “much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.” A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration must temporarily lift its freeze on funding for USAID and said it must show it’s in compliance within five days. Mexico said it might sue Google for changing its maps to show the Gulf of America rather than the Gulf of Mexico. Vice President JD Vance met with the leader of Germany’s far-right party yesterday, after giving a speech assailing European leaders. Bankrupt craft retailer Joann is on track to close 500 stores. Elizabeth Holmes told People Magazine that she’s still writing patents and hopes to continue her career in healthcare technology after her release from prison.

      "content": "THE BIG IDEA Jeff Bezos will step down as Amazon’s CEO Yesterday, Amazon announced Q4 2020 earnings of ~$126B — the e-comm giant’s first $100B+ quarter. But the company’s spicy financials were overshadowed by a bigger piece of news: Jeff Bezos is resigning as Amazon’s CEO. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Bezos has been more of an executive chairman in recent years, trying not to “schedule meetings before 10 a.m. and to make all of his tough decisions before 5 p.m.” Bezos founded Amazon in 1994… … and since its IPO in May 1997, he’s seen the company’s value explode from ~$300m to ~$1.7T. The pandemic has been a massive tailwind for Amazon’s business, with ecomm deliveries surging and remote work juicing its cloud business. In Q4 alone, the company hired 175k employees, expanding its workforce to ~1.3m. This business success has invited regulatory scrutiny, with Amazon facing antitrust probes from in the US and Europe. Andy Jassey is taking over the top spot A Harvard Business School grad who’s been at Amazon since 1997, Jassy was one of 2 key execs (along with Jeff Wilke) who Bezos tasked with overseeing the company’s day-to-day responsibilities in 2016. As the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, Jasse has been a critical driver of the company’s growth in recent years. How critical? Investor Jon Sakoda believes Amazon’s cloud business would be worth $2T-$4T as a standalone stock, based on public company cloud multiples. What’s next for Bezos? Like many of us, Jeff enjoys the occasional side hustle. The only difference is that his side hustle — selling $1B of $AMZN stock per year to fund his space company, Blue Origin — happens to pit him against the world’s second richest person, who also wants to “colonize the cosmos.” Bezos can focus full-time on this hobby in Q3 2021, when he’ll transition to the executive chairman role on Amazon’s board. “Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy,” Bezos wrote in an email to employees. “Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.” SNIPPETS The South African Revenue Service (SARS) hasn’t migrated its e-filing forms from Flash — which Adobe no longer supports — to HTML. Solution: Pay Russian coders to make a custom Flash browser. (We wrote about the end of Flash here.) An anonymous startup has raised $3m… to give it all away. What’s the catch? Per TechCrunch, it’s a customer acquisition play for a TBA fintech product. Investors include Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and Allbirds CEO Joey Zwillinger. Drink it up: Uber is acquiring alcohol-delivery startup Drizly for ~$1.1B and will integrate the app into Uber Eats. This is a change for Uber’s recent M&A strategy of… selling stuff (to focus on delivery and ride-sharing). An OS for the music industry: Music manager and tech founder Daouda Leonard released “Publishing Simulator,” a tool for artists to find out how much publishing income they can earn from streaming. (Check out our Q&A with him here.) Tesla is recalling ~135k Model S and Model X vehicles after regulators found problems with the touch-screen display. 2021 bingo card: “After Myanmar coup, Facebook removes national military TV network’s page,” per the Wall Street Journal. Not peanuts. Kraft Heinz is in talks to sell Planters — the legendary nut brand with the monocled Mr. Peanut — for ~$3B to Hormel. Google Cloud Business lost $5.6B last year… but is growing fast (50% YoY) and notched a full year revenue of $13B. MASSIVE FUNDING data lakehouse Databricks raises $1B (at a $28B valuation!) to build ‘data lakehouses’ In what’s beginning to feel like a daily ritual, another tech company — this time, Databricks — announced $1B in Series G funding at a $28B valuation. The company’s investor roster sounds like the VC equivalent of the 1992 US men’s basketball Dream Team: T. Rowe Price, Tiger Global, BlackRock, a16z, Franklin Templeton, Coatue, Fidelity, Amazon, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Microsoft, among others. Databricks builds ‘data lakehouses’ These are a new form of cloud storage systems that companies can use to store structured and unstructured data while layering business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) tools on top. Built by gangster Berkeley academics, Databricks closed 2020 with $425m in ARR — up 75% YoY — and has 5k+ customers. The new funding — which values Databricks at a casual ~65x multiple — will be spent on expanding Databricks’ global footprint, hiring talent, and R&D. But Databricks has some competition You might remember this other data lake company, Snowflake, which had the largest software IPO ever in September. Snowflake’s revenue grew 119% YoY in Q3 2020. The Databricks-Snowflake rivalry could get awkward as some investors (ahem, Salesforce) have stakes in both companies. Still, Databricks already exceeded Snowflake’s pre-IPO valuation. And with cloud behemoths AWS, Google, and Microsoft all backing, Databricks has a strategic edge as it plans to go public later this year. Unfortunately, we’ll probably forget about it tomorrow when some other company raises $3B at a $500B valuation.

Invest in Caliber → JOURNALISM’S VC Laurene Powell Jobs Laurene Powell Jobs is trying to save journalism through funding Laurene Powell Jobs — Steve Jobs’ widow — claims she named her charitable organization the Emerson Collective after Ralph Waldo Emerson, in honor of his essay “Self-Reliance.” It just so happens Emerson Street was also the location of her first date with Steve. Coincidence? We think not. Anyway, Emerson is equipped with $1.8B+ in assets and has recently been working to instill self-reliance in American journalism. “Journalism is a cornerstone of our democracy… … and we see that it’s dying,” Emerson’s director of media told the Columbia Journalism Review. “We want to try and help save it.” Today, Emerson looks like a charitable VC firm. While its ~$250m investments in journalism include $37m to nonprofits, it also includes $110m for a 70% stake in The Atlantic. Aside from The Atlantic — whose paywall brought in ~400k subscribers in 2020 — Emerson is also invested in for-profit media firms Axios, The Athletic, Anonymous Content, and Pushkin Industries. Emerson is run like a business The organization’s structure as an LLC — though mainly for privacy purposes — is symbolic of the fact that Powell Jobs expects investments will turn a profit. In May, The Atlantic laid off 68 employees as revenue sunk. Then in August, Emerson cut ties with Pop Up Magazine, whose pre-COVID projections had it losing $3m in 2020. Still, this could likely only be the beginning of Emerson’s foray into media. Last year, Powell Jobs told the New York Times her fortune “ends with me.” **Pulls out calculator**… There’s a solid $22B+ to go. family-run firms Why does Germany have so many family-run firms? We don’t cover a ton of German companies here, but The Economist dropped some interesting stats on Deutschland industry: 90%+ of German firms are family companies. This includes all types of firms from carmakers (BMW, VW) to engineering (Bosch) to medicine (Merck) to retail (Aldi, Lidl). What’s with the family affair? The Economist offers up 2 potential reasons: Inheritance tax: Compared to America or France, Germany’s inheritance tax is much lower and can actually be waived if the heirs keep the lights on for 7 years and keep staff onboard. Perception of entrepreneurs: In America, the self-made man is praised, while Germans have a soft spot for old money. Succession planning is a big deal in Germany… … which has a history of sibling breakups. Perhaps most famously, the Dassler brothers split in 1948 to create 2 of Europe’s most well-known shoe firms: Adidas and Puma. A more recent story is completely bonkers. Karl-Erivan Haub — the 5th-generation CEO of Tengelmann, a billion-dollar retail empire — went missing nearly 3 years ago. After he was presumed dead, the family company has been dealing with inheritance disarray… it’s so bad that Christian Haub (a brother) no longer wants Haub declared dead. There really is no drama like family drama.

Meta ends fact-checking program Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system on Elon Musk’s platform X.

UK’s long-term borrowing costs surge Yields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic’s potential $60 billion valuation Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon , is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock market Howard Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn’t calling it a bubble, he’s concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here’s what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. The bottom line In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management’s services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shockwaves through the market. The price index for December’s ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It’s the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM’s Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to “risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs” — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. “You’re getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That’s triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm,” said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy’s still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, “profit growth matters more” than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn’t chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now.",

  "analysis": "Here is a synthesized Finance newsletter focused on the key developments and insights from the provided content:\n\nMarkets Tumble as Inflation Fears Reignite\n\nU.S. stocks fell sharply on Tuesday while Treasury yields surged to their highest levels since April, as December's ISM services index jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November. The unexpected surge in service sector prices, representing the first reading above 60% since January 2024, sparked concerns that inflation may be rearing its head again.\n\nThe S&P 500 slid 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.89%, with Nvidia's 6.2% slump ending its three-day rally. Investors are now recalibrating their inflation and interest rate expectations, pricing in just a 4.8% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's January meeting, down from 8.6% a day earlier.\n\nHowever, some analysts point out that the strong ISM report also indicates the U.S. economy remains resilient, which could support corporate profit growth. As UBS's David Lefkowitz notes, \"profit growth matters more\" than valuation for stock returns over the next 12 months. Still, investors should remain cautious until a clearer inflation picture emerges. \n\nIn other news:\n\n- Meta is shutting down its third-party fact-checking program ahead of President-elect Trump's inauguration, prompting backlash from employees.\n\n- UK gilt yields hit their highest levels since the late 1990s on weak demand, stoking stagflation fears.\n\n- AI startup Anthropic is reportedly close to raising funds at a $60 billion valuation, underscoring the sector's red-hot growth.\n\nThe bottom line: With inflation jitters suddenly back in the spotlight, markets are entering a skittish phase as investors reassess the macro picture for 2025. Until greater clarity emerges, a defensive stance may be prudent. At the same time, a still-robust economy could provide ongoing support for corporate earnings and selective opportunities for discerning investors.",
