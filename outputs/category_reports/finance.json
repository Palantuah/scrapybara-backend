      "content": "Good morning. Corporate execs and Mafia bosses can agree on one thing: Gen Z workers put too much emphasis on work-life balance. Giancarlo Romano, the alleged don of Sicily’s notorious Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was recently caught on wiretap complaining about the quality of new recruits, calling the young up-and-comers “miserable.” He grumbled that the organization currently has a fraction of the influence Vito Corleone had in The Godfather, which was based on Cosa Nostra. \n\nJust wait until he tries to bring them back to the office.\n\n—Sam Klebanov, Molly Liebergall, Matty Merritt, Abby Rubenstein, Neal Freyman  \n\n### MARKETS  \nNasdaq 20,026.77 +0.41%  \nS&P 6,114.63 -0.01%  \nDow 44,546.08 -0.37%  \n10-Year 4.472% -5.0 bps  \nBitcoin $97,257.91 +0.80%  \n*Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 6:00pm ET. Here's what these numbers mean.*  \n\nMarkets: Like most of us plan to do over the long weekend, stocks didn’t move much yesterday—though they did knock out a winning week. Airbnb had its best day ever after its Q4 earnings beat expectations, and its CEO laid out a vision for the company—whose cleaning fees you love to mock—to become the “Amazon” of travel.\n\n### GOVERNMENT  \n# Trump puts defense cuts on the menu  \nYasin Ozturk/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump said this week he’ll seek a nuclear weapons deal with US geopolitical foes China and Russia, and that he wants the trio to eventually agree to halve their military spending. \n\nAchieving such a trilateral agreement is a tall order, but that didn’t stop stocks of companies that supply Uncle Sam with the lethal machinery it uses to fight its adversaries from taking a nosedive at the suggestion.\n\n  * Shares in the largest US military contractor, Lockheed Martin, which got more than $68 billion in Pentagon business in 2023, dropped almost 5% since Trump’s remarks Thursday.\n  * Stocks of fellow defense dollar recipients RTX and Northrop Grumman plummeted 4% and 7%, respectively.\n\nBut the Department of Defense—which is the federal government’s largest department, with an $800 billion budget—might start tightening its belt long before Trump pitches Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin on a military thriftiness pledge.\n\n## DOGE is knocking at the Pentagon\n\nTrump has reportedly directed the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to scrutinize defense spending. Pentagon officials told NPR they expect DOGE to begin its work there in the coming days and that it’ll target an 8% spending cut.\n\n  * Defense Secretary Hegseth previously suggested that some top-ranking positions might be eliminated as the department reviews the 3 million people it employs in both uniformed and civilian roles.\n  * DOGE will also likely audit the equipment the military orders with some services reportedly already floating purchases to cut, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLawmakers and experts of all political stripes have long criticized legacy weapons programs that are plagued with cost overruns and often yield tech of questionable usefulness—with Musk himself recently dunking on the uber-pricey F-35 jets.\n\nBut slashing military costs could be politically tricky as defense contractors employ more than 2 million people across the country. Plus, Musk spearheading the effort presents a potential conflict of interest, as SpaceX is itself a Pentagon contractor.\n\nBut not the entire weapons business stands to lose: Trump's Pentagon is expected to favor autonomous systems, which could benefit defense startups like the AI company Palantir and the dronemaker Anduril. Palantir shares rose over 6% this week.—SK  \n\n### STAT  \n# Prime number: Shopping is dropping  \nSean Justice/Getty Images\n\nIf your favorite store clerk isn’t smiling quite as widely as usual when they greet you today, it could be because data released yesterday showed that US retail sales experienced their biggest decline in nearly two years last month. Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January, marking the steepest monthly decrease since March 2023, according to the Commerce Department. The big dip came on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in December, the department said.\n\nWhy aren’t Americans giving in to their inner shopaholic any more? Part of the reason could simply be seasonality as everyone comes down from their holiday-buying binge. Plus, the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and severe winter storms hitting large swaths of the country might have made getting out to brick-and-mortar stores harder than usual. But with sales going down across nine of the 13 categories tracked—motor vehicles, sporting goods, and furniture fell the most—Bloomberg notes that it could be driven by more than just bad weather as consumers continue to contend with high inflation, which could be a worrying sign for the economy.—AR  \n\n### NEWS  \n# What else is brewing  \n  * OpenAI’s board unanimously rejected Elon Musk’s unsolicited $97.4 billion offer to buy the ChatGPT-maker, saying the “much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.”\n  * A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration must temporarily lift its freeze on funding for USAID and said it must show it’s in compliance within five days.\n  * Mexico said it might sue Google for changing its maps to show the Gulf of America rather than the Gulf of Mexico.\n  * Vice President JD Vance met with the leader of Germany’s far-right party yesterday, after giving a speech assailing European leaders.\n  * Bankrupt craft retailer Joann is on track to close 500 stores.\n  * Elizabeth Holmes told People Magazine that she’s still writing patents and hopes to continue her career in healthcare technology after her release from prison.\n  * If you want to spend your weekend catching up on everything President Trump has done in the first 25 days of his second term, here are roundups of his biggest moves, lawsuits challenging many of those moves, regulatory changes, and cuts made by DOGE.\n\n### RECS  \nJam session: An aesthetically-pleasing portable speaker.**  \nWatch: What would happen if you made a billion-story building?  \nDebate: The 100 greatest TV performances of the century.  \nPlay games and do good: This website donates rice to the UN’s World Food Programme when you answer vocab questions correctly.  \nGet $2.70/share by Feb. 27: Pacaso is taking their disruptive model worldwide, building off record success in Paris.

Listen to today’s 10-minute podcast to hear Jacob and Rob break down what’s going on at Twitter, some bad news if the Phillies win the World Series, Amazon’s push into sports, and more.  \n\nTHE BIG IDEA  \n\n## What’s happening with Twitter?  \n\nIf you’ve been following the Twitter developments since Friday, then you’re well aware the developments are very much… developing.\n\nAt the center of it is Elon Musk and an inner circle working to quickly implement changes to the company and platform.\n\n#### So, what’s happened so far?\n\nFirst came the sink. Then firing Parag Agrawal, the now-former CEO. Then the firing of “Rahul Ligma” — which, unsurprisingly, was a prank.\n\nOver the weekend, reports continued circulating about potential layoffs, which are now widely expected. Throughout, Musk has tweeted some updates, including plans for the formation of a content moderation council.\n\nBoth Musk and friend Jason Calacanis — a VC and Twitter’s self-proclaimed “Chief Meme Officer” — have surveyed users about bringing back Vine, the short-form video app (basically, TikTok before TikTok) that Twitter shut down in 2016.\n\n#### What’s this about charging for verification?\n\nMusk’s team is also revamping Twitter’s verification process, possibly looking to charge $19.99 a month for verification.\n\nIt seems unlikely that decision would have a wide-scale fiscal impact, though: In a poll run by Calacanis, 81.5% of ~1.6m users said they wouldn’t pay for verification.\n\nOpinions on the implications of such a move vary:\n\n  * Calacanis contends wide-scale verification is “the quickest way to make the platform safer & more usable.”\n  * On the other hand, some experts think charging for verification could lead to an increase in scams and impersonation.\n\nOthers have suggested alternative approaches, like charging for *other* features (e.g., video hosting), offering multiple tiers of verification, or charging a smaller amount (say, $5). The situation remains fluid, with Musk indicating that “the entire verification process is being revamped right now.” We’ll see.\n\nCHART  \n\n## Should we be worried about a Phillies World Series title?  \n\nPhiladelphia sports fans have a bit of a reputation (see here, here, and here).\n\nWhile a chaotic, booze-soaked celebration — and a few incidents of rioting and brawling — followed the Eagles’ 2018 Super Bowl victory, something more disruptive could be looming with a Phillies win.\n\n#### All three Philadelphia baseball titles…\n\n… have been followed by a recession, per The Wall Street Journal.\n\n  * In 1929, the Philadelphia Athletics’ championship was followed by the Great Depression.\n  * In 1980, the Phillies’ first title was followed by a three-year recession.\n  * In 2008, the Phillies’ most recent win was followed by the financial crisis.\n\nMany will still be rooting for them. Their opponent, the Houston Astros, have garnered a reputation as the “new evil empire,” making four World Series in six years, all while battling cheating allegations.\n\nPlus, if a Phillies win is followed by an economic downturn, it’s not like we haven’t been warned already.  \n\nCOLOR WARS  \n\n## Pantone colors are disappearing from Adobe  \n\nThings are about to get less colorful for Adobe software users.\n\nPantone is paywalling 15k colors in products including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign this month, per Vice.\n\nFor designers who don’t pay up, some colors will switch to black.\n\n#### What’s a Pantone Color?\n\nIn 1963, Pantone developed the Pantone Matching System, which standardizes colors across industries and materials.\n\nFor example: You want your business logo to be “Very Peri,” Pantone’s 2022 Color of the Year.\n\nBy using Peri’s ID (Pantone 17-3938) when you send your logo to the printer, you can guarantee that exact shade always winds up on your ads and T-shirts.\n\n#### Previously…\n\n… Adobe and Pantone had an agreement in which Adobe paid to license Pantone’s color swatches, or “books,” for use in its software.\n\nBut last year, the companies announced that Adobe would remove Pantone’s books, supposedly because they were out of date. (Rumors, however, suggest a disagreement between the companies.)\n\n#### So now…\n\n… people who want to use affected colors must pay $15/mo. for a plug-in, per designer Iain Anderson.\n\nAnd most users can’t just run an older version that still has the old books because Adobe has switched its software to a cloud-based model.\n\nFor a deeper dive, watch Anderson’s explainer here, or check out this podcast episode exploring the Pantone/Adobe breakup.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}",

      "content": "Recap: \n  * Less than two months ago, the OECD – a major economic organization – said that inflation is here to stay for the next two years \n  * The British central bank said last week that it expects inflation to hit 5% by April next year, up from 3% today \n  * And data out earlier this week showed US inflation hitting its highest level in over thirty years\n\n✍️ Connecting The Dots \n\nSkyrocketing energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and labor shortages have all conspired to push up the rate of inflation across the developed world. In fact, the Bank of England admitted just last week that it’s expecting inflation to hit 5% by April next year. That’s big: over the past three decades, there’s only been three instances where inflation was 5% or higher. Plus, data out this week showed that US prices of goods and services rose by 6.2% last month versus the same time last year – the fastest annual rise in over thirty years.\n\nFor now though, central banks are sticking to their guns, claiming that inflation is just “transitory” due to temporary issues caused by the pandemic and the subsequent recovery. But inflation is looking increasingly less transitory. Six months ago, we saw extreme blips in the prices of goods directly affected by the pandemic, like fuel and cars. And now those effects are waning, sure, but broader gauges of prices are surging. For example, the Cleveland Fed publishes a “trimmed mean” of inflation that excludes the biggest outlier components. And this measure – which is particularly popular with economists – jumped to its highest level in three decades last month.\n\nEarlier this year, central banks put forward another argument: that the high inflation numbers are distorted because of the “base effect”, meaning the low level of prices last year (due to pandemic shutdowns) led to elevated year-on-year inflation readings. And so they proposed looking at inflation measured over 24 months instead. But not only has this measure of inflation steadily crept up over the past five months, it’s also just hit its highest level since the global financial crisis. So it seems no matter how you dissect it, inflation is looking increasingly like it’s here to stay…\n\nTakeaways \n\n1. Central banks have a tricky decision to make.  \nAt least a tight labor market has got wages rising – problem is, they’re not increasing fast enough to keep up with inflation. That means employees’ real wages – that is, their earnings adjusted for inflation – are actually declining, denting people’s spending power. That’s bad news for most developed countries: consumer spending is by far the largest driver of their economies, so an inflation-driven dent in spending can lead to weaker economic growth. That means central banks have a conundrum on their hands: they should implement economy-boosting measures when growth is falling, but have to withdraw them when inflation is running too hot.\n\n2. You can adjust your portfolio to survive this environment.  \nTraditional bonds aren’t faring too well: their fixed, future payments are worth less when the prices of goods and services tick higher. So inflation-linked bonds, whose principal and interest payments rise and fall with the rate of inflation, could be a smarter investment. And if central banks are forced to raise interest rates to cool down inflation, that could cause value stocks to outperform expensive-looking growth stocks. That’s because the latter promise tasty earnings in the future, but higher interest rates reduce the present-day value of those future earnings. There’s also gold – it’s traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge – and cryptocurrencies, which are starting to be viewed by some investors as a potential hedge for times like this.\n\nAlso On Our Radar \n\nPeloton shares tanked 35% last Friday after the at-home exercise equipment maker cut its revenue and subscriber forecasts. Demand is down now that gym-goers can, you know, go back to gyms, and investors are getting worried that other pandemic-boosted stocks might start coming back down to earth now that lockdowns seem to be behind us.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
