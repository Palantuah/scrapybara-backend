      "content": "Good Morning!\n\nWe’ve got bargain basketball. All 30 NBA teams were in action on the same night — a rarity that only occurs a few times a year. Four guys went for 40-plus (KAT, Kyrie Irving, Jordan Poole and Jamal Murray). That’s one short of the NBA record for the most 40-pieces in one day.\n\nThere were also goals aplenty in the NHL’s 4 Nations showdown and the Champions League. Another MLB free agent is off the board, too.\n\nLetter Rip!\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nNBA\n\nAll-30: NBA for Everybody\n\nJamal Murray’s 55 Points, Kyrie Irving’s 3-Point Barrage, Knicks-Hawks Chaos & More From an All-30 Night in the NBA\n\nFifteen games in one night? Yes, please. The perfect way to transition into NBA All-Star Weekend was an all-30 night of NBA action. Fifteen games featuring every team meant six-plus hours of hoops highlights across the country. There were four 40-point scorers; just one short of the NBA record for most in one night. Here are the top stories from a special evening in the Association:\n\nJamal Murray Notches Career-High 55 — Have a night, Mr. Murray! The Nuggets’ star guard hung a career-high 55 on the Blazers in a win (132-121). Murray hit seven 3s (20-for-36 FG). It’s his fourth career 50-point game.\n\nKyrie Irving Catches Fire From 3 — The short-handed Mavericks welcomed the Warriors to Dallas, and it was the Kyrie Irving show in the second half. Kyrie (42 points) went 7-for-10 from 3, including a stretch of four straight in the 4th quarter. Dallas won (111-107).\n\nKnicks-Hawks Classic at MSG — The Hawks and Knicks battled into the night at MSG with one of the most exciting finishes of the season. All the stars showed out — Karl-Anthony Towns (44 pts), Jalen Brunson (36 pts), Trae Young (38 pts). Atlanta rallied in the 4th, but Brunson hit the game-winner with 11 seconds left in OT (Knicks win, 149-148, OT).\n\nBronny’s New Career-High — The Lakers fell to the Jazz in an awkward night for L.A. (131-119) where Luka Doncic (16 pts) and LeBron James (18 pts) failed to crack 20. One silver lining was Bronny James’ career-high 9 points (Two 3s) in just eight minutes. \n\nKevin Durant’s 30K Encore — KD hit the 30,000-point milestone earlier in the week. He followed it up with 37 last night, but the Suns are in rough shape. Phoenix lost to the Rockets (119-111), and they’ve dropped six of their last seven.\n\nNBA All-30 Highlights: Celtics def. Spurs (116-103) | Magic def. Hornets (102-86) | Pacers def. Wizards (134-130, OT) | Nets def. 76ers (100-96) | Cavaliers def. Raptors (131-108) | Pistons def. Bulls (128-110) | Bucks def. T-Wolves (103-101) | Kings def. Pelicans (119-111) | Thunder def. Heat (115-101) | Clippers def. Grizzlies (128-114) | Jazz def. Lakers (131-119) | Rockets def. Suns (119-111) | Nuggets def. Blazers (132-121) | Mavericks def. Warriors (111-107) | Knicks def. Hawks (149-148, OT)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nNHL\n\n4 Nations: 1-And-Oh, Canada\n\nSidney Crosby (3 Assists), Mitch Marner (OT Winner) Lift Canada Over Sweden (4-3, OT) in 4 Nations Opener\n\nWe’re skating in the Great White North. Canada and Sweden dropped the puck on the NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off last night with a thrilling start. The Canadians might have too much firepower for anybody in this thing. Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid is a front line force that might break the brains of hockey fans. Sid the Kid (3 assists) was dishing dimes all night, and Mitch Marner fired the top-shelf winner 6:06 into OT on a breakaway (4-3, OT). That’s 1-and-Oh, Canada.\n\nWatch: Canada def. Sweden (4-3, OT)\n\nNext Game (Tonight): USA vs. Finland (8:00 pm, ESPN)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nUCL KOs: Day 2 Drama\n\nBayern Survive Celtic Rally, But Italian Sides Milan & Atalanta Tumble\n\nKicking contests were at it again. The UEFA Champions League produced four one-goal matches on Wednesday, which should make next week very interesting. Bayern hung on to beat Celtic (2-1) thanks to a beaut from Harry Kane. Feyenoord scooped a win over Milan (1-0) thanks a super early goal (3rd minute) that proved to be enough. Benfica and Club Brugge were also narrow winners, and it’s looking like a lot of narrow aggregate scorelines to bring the drama in next week’s second legs. Six of the eight KO Playoffs are separated by one goal entering next week. More fun ahead.\n\nChampions League Highlights: Bayern def. Celtic (2-1) | Club Brugge def. Atalanta (2-1) | Feyenoord def. Milan (1-0) | Benfica def. Monaco (1-0) | The Champions League Bracket\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nMLB\n\nBoston Swings for Bregman\n\nRed Sox Sign Two-Time World Series Champ Alex Bregman to 3-Year, $120 Million Deal\n\nThe biggest remaining free agent in baseball is now off the market. The Boston Red Sox signed 3B Alex Bregman to a 3-year, $120 million deal yesterday. The connection between Bregman and Red Sox manager Alex Cora stems back to their days together in Houston. The two-time All-Star won two titles and spent all nine seasons with the Astros, but he’s heading to the northeast before his 31st birthday.\n\nBregman hit .260 with 26 HRs and 75 RBIs in 2024, so he’s got some juice left.\n\nRead More  \nCBS Sports: Alex Bregman Signs With Red Sox on 3-Year, $120 Million Deal&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}",
