Morning Brew,Morning Brew,"February 15, 2025","February 15, 2025 Morning Brew Pacaso Good morning. Corporate execs and Mafia bosses can agree on one thing: Gen Z workers put too much emphasis on work-life balance. Giancarlo Romano, the alleged don of Sicily’s notorious Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was recently caught on wiretap complaining about the quality of new recruits, calling the young up-and-comers “miserable.” He grumbled that the organization currently has a fraction of the influence Vito Corleone had in The Godfather, which was based on Cosa Nostra. Just wait until he tries to bring them back to the office. —Sam Klebanov, Molly Liebergall, Matty Merritt, Abby Rubenstein, Neal Freyman MARKETS Nasdaq 20,026.77 +0.41% S&P 6,114.63 -0.01% Dow 44,546.08 -0.37% 10-Year 4.472% -5.0 bps Bitcoin $97,257.91 +0.80% Airbnb $161.42 +14.45% Data is provided by *Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 6:00pm ET. Here's what these numbers mean. Markets: Like most of us plan to do over the long weekend, stocks didn’t move much yesterday—though they did knock out a winning week. Airbnb had its best day ever after its Q4 earnings beat expectations, and its CEO laid out a vision for the company—whose cleaning fees you love to mock—to become the “Amazon” of travel. GOVERNMENT Trump puts defense cuts on the menu Defense Department Yasin Ozturk/Getty Images President Donald Trump said this week he’ll seek a nuclear weapons deal with US geopolitical foes China and Russia, and that he wants the trio to eventually agree to halve their military spending. Achieving such a trilateral agreement is a tall order, but that didn’t stop stocks of companies that supply Uncle Sam with the lethal machinery it uses to fight its adversaries from taking a nosedive at the suggestion. Shares in the largest US military contractor, Lockheed Martin, which got more than $68 billion in Pentagon business in 2023, dropped almost 5% since Trump’s remarks Thursday. Stocks of fellow defense dollar recipients RTX and Northrop Grumman plummeted 4% and 7%, respectively. But the Department of Defense—which is the federal government’s largest department, with an $800 billion budget—might start tightening its belt long before Trump pitches Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin on a military thriftiness pledge. DOGE is knocking at the Pentagon Trump has reportedly directed the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to scrutinize defense spending. Pentagon officials told NPR they expect DOGE to begin its work there in the coming days and that it’ll target an 8% spending cut. Defense Secretary Hegseth previously suggested that some top-ranking positions might be eliminated as the department reviews the 3 million people it employs in both uniformed and civilian roles. DOGE will also likely audit the equipment the military orders with some services reportedly already floating purchases to cut, per the Wall Street Journal. Lawmakers and experts of all political stripes have long criticized legacy weapons programs that are plagued with cost overruns and often yield tech of questionable usefulness—with Musk himself recently dunking on the uber-pricey F-35 jets. But slashing military costs could be politically tricky as defense contractors employ more than 2 million people across the country. Plus, Musk spearheading the effort presents a potential conflict of interest, as Space X is itself a Pentagon contractor. But not the entire weapons business stands to lose: Trump's Pentagon is expected to favor autonomous systems, which could benefit defense startups like the AI company Palantir and the dronemaker Anduril. Palantir shares rose over 6% this week.—SK Presented by Pacaso Top investors are buying this “unlisted” stock Pacaso When the team that co-founded Zillow and grew it into a $16b real estate leader starts a new company, investors notice.

WORLD Tour de headlines Elon Musk and Donald Trump in the Oval Office Jim Watson/Getty Images Thousands of federal workers laid off. On Thursday, one day after the Trump administration moved forward with its voluntary resignation program that 75,000 of the federal governments’ 2.3 million civilian workers signed up for, the administration began to lay off newer employees as part of its Elon Musk-led efforts to cut costs. The layoffs are expected to target most of the 200,000 probationary employees, who have usually been in their jobs for less than a year and do not have the same employment protections as longer standing government workers. Among those let go so far are: 1,000 Veterans Affairs staffers, 3,400 Forest Service employees, and 2,000 Energy Department workers, per the Wall Street Journal. TikTok is back in Apple and Google’s app stores. Apologies to anyone who planned to live large by selling their old TikTok-installed phone on eBay for $10k: Everyone’s favorite Chinese shortform video app and its siblings CapCut and Lemon8 are available for download again in Apple and Google’s US mobile app stores. The tech giants brought the ByteDance apps back on Thursday night after receiving assurances from US Attorney General Pam Bondi that the nationwide ban on TikTok wouldn’t be immediately enforced—meaning they won’t get hit with fines. Though President Trump halted the enforcement shortly after taking office, the ban still stands, and could kick in later if TikTok isn’t sold to an American company. DOJ moves to drop charges against NYC mayor after seven prosecutors resign in protest. The resignations from the Manhattan prosecutors’ office came after the Justice Department ordered them to drop bribery charges against Mayor Eric Adams. And in the kind of scorched earth resignation letter that most of us can only dream of sending, the case’s lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten told the DOJ, “I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.” Amid the rift between career prosecutors and the DOJ, a prosecutor did eventually sign the motion to dismiss that was filed yesterday…but reportedly only to spare colleagues from being fired over their refusal.—AR FOOD & BEV It’s not just eggs, your whole AM plate costs more Fried egg in cast iron pan with dollar sign yolk. Emily Parsons As if nothing is sacred anymore, collapsing into a cracked leather booth and securing a cheap breakfast feast is now at risk. Historically low-cost and popular breakfast staples like eggs, orange juice, and coffee have all seen price jumps, squeezing restaurants and consumers. It’s never a good time for your omelet to cost more, but the business of breakfast and brunch is booming. Yelp clocked 6,421 morning meal restaurants opening last year (up 23% from 2019), and even fast-food chains are beefing up their breakfast offerings. Why is your blue plate special so expensive? Roughly 159 million birds have been slaughtered because of the avian flu. In response, egg prices hit a record $4.95 per dozen last month. Citrus greening, a disease that destroys orange trees, has decimated groves in Florida, leading to some of the worst harvests in 90 years. The average cost of OJ concentrate in the supermarket has jumped nearly 90% since 2020. Poor growing conditions in Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s leading producers of coffee beans, caused beans to hit their highest price in 47 years last November. But people are still going out for breakfast. Foot traffic to restaurants during breakfast has leapt past other times since 2019, and pre-lunch visits accounted for 21% of all trips to restaurants in 2024, according to market research firm Circana as reported by the Associated Press.—MM together with Pacaso Pacaso Real estate disruptors target a $1.3t market.

HEALTH TECH What happens when your pet’s chipmaker goes dark vet scans dog for microchip Dardespot/Getty Images An animal microchip company has incurred the wrath of potentially thousands of Bichon Frisé households: Pet owners are scrambling to re-register their furry friends’ rice-sized implants after the pet-chip maker Save This Life abruptly shut down this week, rendering its microchips effectively useless without its database. Nobody’s answering calls or emails, according to concerned customers, chip distributors, competitors who were interested in buying Save This Life’s data, and even the American Animal Hospital Association, which runs the online registry for looking up a found animal’s chip number. Save This Life lost its business license last year, per Washington Post, possibly over tax payment issues. “Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands” of pets may have gotten Save This Life chips since its founding in 2012, Tom Sharp, president of an American Kennel Club-affiliated nonprofit, estimated. (Only 6 in 10 microchips actually get registered, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.) What to do if you think your baby has this chip: Don’t panic. Veterinary clinics and hospitals that use Save This Life are alerting customers and urging them to re-register their pets with one of the other 40+ microchip companies in the US. You can also check your pet yourself—Save This Life chips start with either 991 or 900164.—ML STAT Prime number: Shopping is dropping A woman holding shopping bags looks in a window Sean Justice/Getty Images If your favorite store clerk isn’t smiling quite as widely as usual when they greet you today, it could be because data released yesterday showed that US retail sales experienced their biggest decline in nearly two years last month. Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January, marking the steepest monthly decrease since March 2023, according to the Commerce Department. The big dip came on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in December, the department said. Why aren’t Americans giving into their inner shopaholic any more? Part of the reason could simply be seasonality as everyone comes down from their holiday-buying binge. Plus, the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and severe winter storms hitting large swaths of the country might have made getting out to brick-and-mortar stores harder than usual. But with sales going down across nine of the 13 categories tracked—motor vehicles, sporting goods, and furniture fell the most—Bloomberg notes that it could be driven by more than just bad weather as consumers continue to contend with high inflation, which could be a worrying sign for the economy.—AR NEWS What else is brewing OpenAI’s board unanimously rejected Elon Musk’s unsolicited $97.4 billion offer to buy the ChatGPT-maker, saying the “much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.” A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration must temporarily lift its freeze on funding for USAID and said it must show it’s in compliance within five days. Mexico said it might sue Google for changing its maps to show the Gulf of America rather than the Gulf of Mexico. Vice President JD Vance met with the leader of Germany’s far-right party yesterday, after giving a speech assailing European leaders. Bankrupt craft retailer Joann is on track to close 500 stores. Elizabeth Holmes told People Magazine that she’s still writing patents and hopes to continue her career in healthcare technology after her release from prison.

Andy Jassy to replace Jeff Bezos,The Hustle,"February 15, 2025","THE BIG IDEA Jeff Bezos will step down as Amazon’s CEO Yesterday, Amazon announced Q4 2020 earnings of ~$126B — the e-comm giant’s first $100B+ quarter. But the company’s spicy financials were overshadowed by a bigger piece of news: Jeff Bezos is resigning as Amazon’s CEO. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Bezos has been more of an executive chairman in recent years, trying not to “schedule meetings before 10 a.m. and to make all of his tough decisions before 5 p.m.” Bezos founded Amazon in 1994… … and since its IPO in May 1997, he’s seen the company’s value explode from ~$300m to ~$1.7T. The pandemic has been a massive tailwind for Amazon’s business, with ecomm deliveries surging and remote work juicing its cloud business. In Q4 alone, the company hired 175k employees, expanding its workforce to ~1.3m. This business success has invited regulatory scrutiny, with Amazon facing antitrust probes from in the US and Europe. Andy Jassey is taking over the top spot A Harvard Business School grad who’s been at Amazon since 1997, Jassy was one of 2 key execs (along with Jeff Wilke) who Bezos tasked with overseeing the company’s day-to-day responsibilities in 2016. As the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, Jasse has been a critical driver of the company’s growth in recent years. How critical? Investor Jon Sakoda believes Amazon’s cloud business would be worth $2T-$4T as a standalone stock, based on public company cloud multiples. What’s next for Bezos? Like many of us, Jeff enjoys the occasional side hustle. The only difference is that his side hustle — selling $1B of $AMZN stock per year to fund his space company, Blue Origin — happens to pit him against the world’s second richest person, who also wants to “colonize the cosmos.” Bezos can focus full-time on this hobby in Q3 2021, when he’ll transition to the executive chairman role on Amazon’s board. “Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy,” Bezos wrote in an email to employees. “Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.” SNIPPETS The South African Revenue Service (SARS) hasn’t migrated its e-filing forms from Flash — which Adobe no longer supports — to HTML. Solution: Pay Russian coders to make a custom Flash browser. (We wrote about the end of Flash here.) An anonymous startup has raised $3m… to give it all away. What’s the catch? Per TechCrunch, it’s a customer acquisition play for a TBA fintech product. Investors include Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and Allbirds CEO Joey Zwillinger. Drink it up: Uber is acquiring alcohol-delivery startup Drizly for ~$1.1B and will integrate the app into Uber Eats. This is a change for Uber’s recent M&A strategy of… selling stuff (to focus on delivery and ride-sharing). An OS for the music industry: Music manager and tech founder Daouda Leonard released “Publishing Simulator,” a tool for artists to find out how much publishing income they can earn from streaming. (Check out our Q&A with him here.) Tesla is recalling ~135k Model S and Model X vehicles after regulators found problems with the touch-screen display. 2021 bingo card: “After Myanmar coup, Facebook removes national military TV network’s page,” per the Wall Street Journal. Not peanuts. Kraft Heinz is in talks to sell Planters — the legendary nut brand with the monocled Mr. Peanut — for ~$3B to Hormel. Google Cloud Business lost $5.6B last year… but is growing fast (50% YoY) and notched a full year revenue of $13B. MASSIVE FUNDING data lakehouse Databricks raises $1B (at a $28B valuation!) to build ‘data lakehouses’ In what’s beginning to feel like a daily ritual, another tech company — this time, Databricks — announced $1B in Series G funding at a $28B valuation. The company’s investor roster sounds like the VC equivalent of the 1992 US men’s basketball Dream Team: T. Rowe Price, Tiger Global, BlackRock, a16z, Franklin Templeton, Coatue, Fidelity, Amazon, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Microsoft, among others. Databricks builds ‘data lakehouses’ These are a new form of cloud storage systems that companies can use to store structured and unstructured data while layering business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) tools on top. Built by gangster Berkeley academics, Databricks closed 2020 with $425m in ARR — up 75% YoY — and has 5k+ customers. The new funding — which values Databricks at a casual ~65x multiple — will be spent on expanding Databricks’ global footprint, hiring talent, and R&D. But Databricks has some competition You might remember this other data lake company, Snowflake, which had the largest software IPO ever in September. Snowflake’s revenue grew 119% YoY in Q3 2020. The Databricks-Snowflake rivalry could get awkward as some investors (ahem, Salesforce) have stakes in both companies. Still, Databricks already exceeded Snowflake’s pre-IPO valuation. And with cloud behemoths AWS, Google, and Microsoft all backing, Databricks has a strategic edge as it plans to go public later this year. Unfortunately, we’ll probably forget about it tomorrow when some other company raises $3B at a $500B valuation.

Invest in Caliber → JOURNALISM’S VC Laurene Powell Jobs Laurene Powell Jobs is trying to save journalism through funding Laurene Powell Jobs — Steve Jobs’ widow — claims she named her charitable organization the Emerson Collective after Ralph Waldo Emerson, in honor of his essay “Self-Reliance.” It just so happens Emerson Street was also the location of her first date with Steve. Coincidence? We think not. Anyway, Emerson is equipped with $1.8B+ in assets and has recently been working to instill self-reliance in American journalism. “Journalism is a cornerstone of our democracy… … and we see that it’s dying,” Emerson’s director of media told the Columbia Journalism Review. “We want to try and help save it.” Today, Emerson looks like a charitable VC firm. While its ~$250m investments in journalism include $37m to nonprofits, it also includes $110m for a 70% stake in The Atlantic. Aside from The Atlantic — whose paywall brought in ~400k subscribers in 2020 — Emerson is also invested in for-profit media firms Axios, The Athletic, Anonymous Content, and Pushkin Industries. Emerson is run like a business The organization’s structure as an LLC — though mainly for privacy purposes — is symbolic of the fact that Powell Jobs expects investments will turn a profit. In May, The Atlantic laid off 68 employees as revenue sunk. Then in August, Emerson cut ties with Pop Up Magazine, whose pre-COVID projections had it losing $3m in 2020. Still, this could likely only be the beginning of Emerson’s foray into media. Last year, Powell Jobs told the New York Times her fortune “ends with me.” **Pulls out calculator**… There’s a solid $22B+ to go. family-run firms Why does Germany have so many family-run firms? We don’t cover a ton of German companies here, but The Economist dropped some interesting stats on Deutschland industry: 90%+ of German firms are family companies. This includes all types of firms from carmakers (BMW, VW) to engineering (Bosch) to medicine (Merck) to retail (Aldi, Lidl). What’s with the family affair? The Economist offers up 2 potential reasons: Inheritance tax: Compared to America or France, Germany’s inheritance tax is much lower and can actually be waived if the heirs keep the lights on for 7 years and keep staff onboard. Perception of entrepreneurs: In America, the self-made man is praised, while Germans have a soft spot for old money. Succession planning is a big deal in Germany… … which has a history of sibling breakups. Perhaps most famously, the Dassler brothers split in 1948 to create 2 of Europe’s most well-known shoe firms: Adidas and Puma. A more recent story is completely bonkers. Karl-Erivan Haub — the 5th-generation CEO of Tengelmann, a billion-dollar retail empire — went missing nearly 3 years ago. After he was presumed dead, the family company has been dealing with inheritance disarray… it’s so bad that Christian Haub (a brother) no longer wants Haub declared dead. There really is no drama like family drama.

CNBC Daily Open,CNBC Daily Open,"February 15, 2025","What you need to know today Inflation fears drag down U.S. markets U.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe’s regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024. Meta ends fact-checking program Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system on Elon Musk’s platform X.

UK’s long-term borrowing costs surge Yields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic’s potential $60 billion valuation Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon , is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock market Howard Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn’t calling it a bubble, he’s concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here’s what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. The bottom line In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management’s services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shockwaves through the market. The price index for December’s ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It’s the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM’s Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to “risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs” — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. “You’re getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That’s triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm,” said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy’s still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, “profit growth matters more” than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn’t chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now.",Finance,d5e4f8a2

"5 things to know for Feb. 13, 2025",CNN 5 Things,"February 15, 2025","(CNN) — Severe winter weather is disrupting travel and commutes across the US, with data showing thousands of recent flight cancellations and delays. Millions of people on the West Coast are currently under alerts for flooding rainfall, while snow and ice continue to pound several central and eastern states.

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.

## 1. Federal firings

Scores of firings have begun at federal agencies, with terminations of probationary employees underway at the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration, sources told CNN. The moves mark the first from the Trump administration as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency aims to dramatically shrink the federal workforce and pull back on government spending. Until now, federal employees across all US agencies had only been placed on paid administrative leave. The full scope of the firings remains unclear, though it has impacted at least dozens of workers.

## 2. Trump-Putin call

President Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after he held a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The two leaders discussed the future of the conflict and “agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,” Trump said. His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also reaffirmed that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration focuses on securing US borders and deterring war with China.

## 3. Inflation

Despite promises from President Trump to bring prices down, many common goods and services in the US got more expensive last month. Inflation jumped to 3% — its highest rate since June of last year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase was driven by many factors, including the rising costs of energy and food. That’s particularly true of eggs, which have seen prices soar and widespread shortages due to avian flu. Egg prices, which are up 53% year-over-year, shot up more than 15% from December to January.

## 4. Homelessness

City and state officials in parts of the US are uncertain how to respond to a surge in homelessness and encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in parks. Meanwhile, people who live in those encampments and advocacy groups say they are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing. This week, the city council in Fremont, California, voted to criminalize “aiding” and “abetting” homeless camps — an unusual move that advocates say could stifle help for people who need it. The new policy comes about seven months after the Supreme Court ruled that ticketing homeless people does not constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.”

## 5. Taiwan explosion

A blast inside a shopping mall in Taiwan earlier today killed at least five people and injured several others, according to local officials. Dramatic videos of the explosion in the city of Taichung, on the island’s west coast, showed debris and large panels of a building’s exterior blown out as a loud bang is heard. Footage shot by bystanders of the aftermath showed the street below littered with debris as hundreds evacuated the area. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te urged authorities to investigate the cause of the accident.

NBA All-30: Everybody Plays,The Sportsletter,"February 15, 2025","Good Morning!

We’ve got bargain basketball. All 30 NBA teams were in action on the same night — a rarity that only occurs a few times a year. Four guys went for 40-plus (KAT, Kyrie Irving, Jordan Poole and Jamal Murray). That’s one short of the NBA record for the most 40-pieces in one day.

There were also goals aplenty in the NHL’s 4 Nations showdown and the Champions League. Another MLB free agent is off the board, too.

All-30: NBA for Everybody

Jamal Murray’s 55 Points, Kyrie Irving’s 3-Point Barrage, Knicks-Hawks Chaos & More From an All-30 Night in the NBA

Fifteen games in one night? Yes, please. The perfect way to transition into NBA All-Star Weekend was an all-30 night of NBA action. Fifteen games featuring every team meant six-plus hours of hoops highlights across the country. There were four 40-point scorers; just one short of the NBA record for most in one night. Here are the top stories from a special evening in the Association:

Jamal Murray Notches Career-High 55 — Have a night, Mr. Murray! The Nuggets’ star guard hung a career-high 55 on the Blazers in a win (132-121). Murray hit seven 3s (20-for-36 FG). It’s his fourth career 50-point game.

Kyrie Irving Catches Fire From 3 — The short-handed Mavericks welcomed the Warriors to Dallas, and it was the Kyrie Irving show in the second half. Kyrie (42 points) went 7-for-10 from 3, including a stretch of four straight in the 4th quarter. Dallas won (111-107).

Knicks-Hawks Classic at MSG — The Hawks and Knicks battled into the night at MSG with one of the most exciting finishes of the season. All the stars showed out — Karl-Anthony Towns (44 pts), Jalen Brunson (36 pts), Trae Young (38 pts). Atlanta rallied in the 4th, but Brunson hit the game-winner with 11 seconds left in OT (Knicks win, 149-148, OT).

Bronny’s New Career-High — The Lakers fell to the Jazz in an awkward night for L.A. (131-119) where Luka Doncic (16 pts) and LeBron James (18 pts) failed to crack 20. One silver lining was Bronny James’ career-high 9 points (Two 3s) in just eight minutes. 

Kevin Durant’s 30K Encore — KD hit the 30,000-point milestone earlier in the week. He followed it up with 37 last night, but the Suns are in rough shape. Phoenix lost to the Rockets (119-111), and they’ve dropped six of their last seven.

NBA All-30 Highlights: Celtics def. Spurs (116-103) | Magic def. Hornets (102-86) | Pacers def. Wizards (134-130, OT) | Nets def. 76ers (100-96) | Cavaliers def. Raptors (131-108) | Pistons def. Bulls (128-110) | Bucks def. T-Wolves (103-101) | Kings def. Pelicans (119-111) | Thunder def. Heat (115-101) | Clippers def. Grizzlies (128-114) | Jazz def. Lakers (131-119) | Rockets def. Suns (119-111) | Nuggets def. Blazers (132-121) | Mavericks def. Warriors (111-107) | Knicks def. Hawks (149-148, OT)

4 Nations: 1-And-Oh, Canada

Sidney Crosby (3 Assists), Mitch Marner (OT Winner) Lift Canada Over Sweden (4-3, OT) in 4 Nations Opener

We’re skating in the Great White North. Canada and Sweden dropped the puck on the NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off last night with a thrilling start. The Canadians might have too much firepower for anybody in this thing. Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid is a front line force that might break the brains of hockey fans. Sid the Kid (3 assists) was dishing dimes all night, and Mitch Marner fired the top-shelf winner 6:06 into OT on a breakaway (4-3, OT). That’s 1-and-Oh, Canada.

Watch: Canada def. Sweden (4-3, OT)

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

UCL KOs: Day 2 Drama

Bayern Survive Celtic Rally, But Italian Sides Milan & Atalanta Tumble

Kicking contests were at it again. The UEFA Champions League produced four one-goal matches on Wednesday, which should make next week very interesting. Bayern hung on to beat Celtic (2-1) thanks to a beaut from Harry Kane. Feyenoord scooped a win over Milan (1-0) thanks a super early goal (3rd minute) that proved to be enough. Benfica and Club Brugge were also narrow winners, and it’s looking like a lot of narrow aggregate scorelines to bring the drama in next week’s second legs. Six of the eight KO Playoffs are separated by one goal entering next week. More fun ahead.

Champions League Highlights: Bayern def. Celtic (2-1) | Club Brugge def. Atalanta (2-1) | Feyenoord def. Milan (1-0) | Benfica def. Monaco (1-0) | The Champions League Bracket

Boston Swings for Bregman

Red Sox Sign Two-Time World Series Champ Alex Bregman to 3-Year, $120 Million Deal

The biggest remaining free agent in baseball is now off the market. The Boston Red Sox signed 3B Alex Bregman to a 3-year, $120 million deal yesterday. The connection between Bregman and Red Sox manager Alex Cora stems back to their days together in Houston. The two-time All-Star won two titles and spent all nine seasons with the Astros, but he’s heading to the northeast before his 31st birthday.

Bregman hit .260 with 26 HRs and 75 RBIs in 2024, so he’s got some juice left.

Politico,Politico,"February 15, 2025","Conversation opened. 1 read message. Skip to content Using Gmail with screen readers 8 of 15 ​​GOP confronts a continental divide Inbox POLITICO Playbook <politicoplaybook@email.politico.com> Unsubscribe 8:47 AM (13 hours ago) to me Feb 15, 2025	View in browser POLITICO Newsletter Header By Adam Wren Presented by the Coalition for Medicare Choices With help from Eli Okun, Garrett Ross and Bethany Irvine Happy Saturday from Indiana, where I have a bit of FOMO about not being in Munich at the POLITICO Pub. I’ll try to remedy that today by having the Hoosier classic breaded pork tenderloin sandwich, which German immigrants brought to the Midwest in the early 1900s by taking the concept of wiener schnitzel, swapping out veal for pork and adding a bun. Drop me a line: awren@politico.com. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Far-right activist Jack Posobiec traveled to Ukraine with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and was in the room when the secretary greeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of their private meeting, POLITICO’s Dasha Burns reports. The background: Earlier this week, WaPo reported that Posobiec was invited to travel with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, sparking alarm from some in the defense world. But the MAGA influencer says he instead opted to travel to Ukraine with Bessent, whose team reached out to Posobiec before the trip was made public. He was invited as media in his role as an influencer. (Mainstream journalists were also among the attendees, including Ed Lawrence from Fox Business.) A new era: Posobiec — whose record of far-right activism includes promoting conspiracy theories and associating with white nationalists — has long been a controversial figure, and would have been considered fringe during prior administrations. But now, he’s in position to bear witness to key moments on one of the world’s most consequential issues. The meeting: Posobiec tells POLITICO that Bessent and team went to Ukraine with the goal of getting Zelenskyy to sign an economic agreement. “It’s been referred to as the mineral deal, although there were other aspects to it besides just minerals,” Posobiec says, noting it also targeted resources like oil and gas. “The economic relationship was meant to be a strong signal both to the Ukrainian people and to Russian leadership that the U.S. would not be abandoning Ukraine.” The timing: The meeting happened right after Hegseth’s speech and right before President Donald Trump posted online that he’d spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. More details: “It was Bessent’s first trip since he was confirmed,” Posobiec says. “He repeated over and over that it was a big signal to Ukrainian leadership that [the] United States intends to continue a relationship with Ukraine even after any peace deal that’s done.” Ukraine’s reaction: “The big piece of it was there was no security guarantee, which became a big sticking point for the Ukrainians,” Posobiec says. “Zelenskyy repeated over and over the need for a security guarantee,” and indicated he’s looking for another arms deal as well as a security agreement. “It seemed Zelenskyy was not happy with what had been presented, and he also stated that he wanted to speak to the president.” How Trump world sees it: “The president wants to support the Ukrainian people, but billions of dollars have been spent, so the question is what do we do going forward?” a person familiar with the situation tells Playbook. “And that is Secretary Bessent’s expertise — understanding global economics and financial agreements. A big part of this is fairness for Americans and making sure the U.S. gets some reciprocal benefits.” A representative for Zelenskyy did not respond to POLITICO’s request for comment by publishing time. POLITICO EXCLUSIVES: Ukraine should get automatic NATO membership if Russia ever invades again, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) proposed at the POLITICO Pub at the Munich Security Conference this morning. “If you can’t get them into NATO right now, my idea with [former British PM] Boris Johnson is to be really clear: Tell Putin if you ever do this again, if there’s another incursion by Russia into Ukraine, that leads to automatic admission into NATO by Ukraine as a tripwire,” Graham told POLITICO’s Jonathan Martin. Music to Trump’s ears: NATO members must boost their defense spending by “considerably more than 3 percent” of GDP, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said today during his own interview at the POLITICO Pub. That comes as Trump demands allies commit 5 percent of GDP to defense, up from the 2 percent NATO members agreed upon more than a decade ago. Not music to Trump’s ears: “Despite U.S. insistence, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to sign a draft agreement to hand over half of his country’s rare earth minerals to American companies in exchange for military support, according to two people familiar with the negotiations,” POLITICO’s Veronika Melkozerova and Joe Gould report. “‘The deal was not signed yet. Sides are discussing the details,’ said a Ukrainian official familiar with the negotiations who was granted anonymity to discuss ongoing talks. … The official added that the U.S. scheme ‘might not work’ as it could fall afoul of Ukrainian law.” Life in the minority party: Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) let loose with a litany of thoughts during his own stint at the POLITICO Pub, ranging from the Democratic Party’s woes (our “brand is really bad,” he told Dasha) … to the dismantling of USAID (“great news for Russia or China”) … to the Department of Government Efficiency’s potential mishandling of classified information (“I have huge security concerns when you have 22-year-olds who may not even appreciate the value of the information you have being so careless”). It’s all part of life during Trump 2.0. “We’re not even a month into this administration,” he said. “In dog years, it feels like it’s been 20 years.” What else is happening at the POLITICO Pub in Munich?

DRIVING THE DAY United States Vice-President JD Vance, second right, and United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio, center, during a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) VP JD Vance’s approach to Europe and President Donald Trump’s call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a Ukraine peace deal point to a new foreign policy consensus that wants to be born. | Matthias Schrader/AP Photo CONTINENTAL DIVIDE: At the Munich Security Conference these past few days, the uncomfortable political alliances of Trump’s winning coalition were on full display. And there was some discord in the GOP’s big foreign policy tent. As a new kind of MAGA military realism continues to graft onto the Republican Party’s body of Reaganesque internationalism, there are signs the old organ is rejecting the new one — or vice versa, depending on one’s perspective. The new GOP’s larger lack of a foreign policy consensus is on full display. On Ukraine: Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) earned a blast of coverage when he told our POLITICO colleague Jonathan Martin that Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” in calling a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders “unrealistic.” On NATO: Graham proposed a conditional path for Ukraine’s NATO membership in conversation with JMart, a rejection of Trump’s contention that Ukraine joining NATO wasn’t “practical.” On Europe: Policymakers across the continent are still reeling from VP JD Vance’s blistering speech yesterday, during which he chided Europe and told it to open up to the far right, as NYT’s Jim Tankersley, Steven Erlanger and David Sanger report. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz derided Vance’s comments, citing Germany’s history with Nazis, Bloomberg’s Christoph Rauwald and Stephanie Lai report. (“No one is talking about anything else,” a senior Eastern European official told POLITICO’s Robbie Gramer, Paul McLeary, Jack Detsch and Joe Gould). Vance’s speech could be remembered as one of the most important speeches a sitting vice president ever delivered. Quick: Recall any speech former VP Mike Pence ever made while in office. How Team Vance sees it: One longtime Vance adviser told Playbook that Vance’s remarks could be understood less as a stick and more as a carrot, calling the continent back to values it shares with the U.S. Both his speech on artificial intelligence, during which he called for “optimism and not trepidation,” and his address yesterday were of a piece. Not a lecture: “He made an intellectual case in both of his speeches this week and extended an olive branch to Europe for them to stand with us on issues like AI and free speech,” said the adviser, granted anonymity to explain Vance’s speech. “This wasn’t a case of JD just lecturing Europe about how bad they are, it was him calling on them to return to the traditional values that they have long shared with us because right now they are out of step. His view is that Europe and America are both stronger when there’s a shared commitment to fundamental values like freedom of speech and national sovereignty.” Labor pains: Taken together, Vance’s approach to Europe — which seemed more aimed at his MAGA base back stateside — and Trump’s call with Putin about a Ukraine peace deal (a conversation that did not include Ukraine) point to a new foreign policy consensus that wants to be born. Europe’s wake-up call: “This is a new United States and it’s clear the old one Europe’s been used to for decades is gone,” one former senior U.S. diplomat told our POLITICO colleagues. “It could be this is the one wake-up call that actually wakes Europe up.” The GOP’s generation gap: But it’s worth taking stock of the ways the larger GOP is reacting to it — and a generational divide that points to Vance’s approach winning the day. Consider, for example, that Wicker is 73. Graham is 69. At 40, Vance’s approach to Europe — and more largely, the world — could be the foreign policy vision that has the most staying power. For Vance, none of this is new: He has said in the past that the U.S. should be less focused on Europe and more focused on East Asia. “That is going to be the future of American foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact,” Vance said in Munich last year. Back then, Vance said, insisted his remarks were meant “in the spirit of friendship, not in the spirit of criticism,” because “I don’t think that we should abandon Europe.” Europe’s not so sure about that: “I really believe that the time has come that the armed forces of Europe must be created,” Zelenskyy said today in a speech at MSC. “Let’s be honest, now we can’t rule out that America might say ‘no’ to Europe on issues that might threaten it.” Up next: “French President Emmanuel Macron is convening European leaders for an emergency summit in Paris on Monday, according to Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski,” reports POLITICO’s Hans von der Burchard. “‘President Trump has a method of operating which the Russians call razvedka boyem — reconnaissance through battle: You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position. … And we need to respond,’ the Polish minister said.” A message from the Coalition for Medicare Choices: Protect Medicare Advantage: 34 million seniors are counting on it. Over half of America’s seniors choose Medicare Advantage because it provides them better care at lower costs than fee-for-service Medicare. With their coverage and care on the line, seniors are watching closely to see whether policymakers keep the bipartisan promise to protect Medicare Advantage by ensuring this vital part of Medicare is adequately funded.

CRISIS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: The Trump administration’s effort to dismiss the federal corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams has triggered massive chaos at DOJ over the rule of law. After multiple prominent conservative prosecutors resigned rather than carry out the directive, acting deputy AG Emil Bove finally signed the formal motion himself yesterday, along with prosecutors Edward Sullivan and Antoinette Bacon, per NYT’s Benjamin Weiser, William Rashbaum and Jonah Bromwich. Notably, Bove wrote that the dismissal was not about weakness in the case but specifically about clearing the way for Adams to work with Trump on immigration. That’s a different tune than AG Pam Bondi, who decried without evidence the “weaponization” of prosecutions. Adams has pleaded not guilty. The extraordinary sequence of events saw U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon quit alongside several others, including lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten, who blasted DOJ and declared he’d never be “enough of a fool, or enough of a coward,” to comply. At the Justice Department, there is widespread outrage over the situation, POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein reports, including an allegation that Bove had threatened the entire Public Integrity Section with being fired if nobody stepped forward to carry out the Adams order. (NYT’s Adam Liptak dives into the conservative legal divide over whether prosecutors should obey unjust orders.) The two big questions now: Will federal judge Dale Ho allow the prosecutors to drop the case? Judges almost always do, but the Joe Biden appointee now faces a situation with little precedent, NYT’s Weiser and Bromwich write. And if the legal case ends, could New York Gov. Kathy Hochul remove Adams from office? Some Democrats are urging her to do so, but Hochul is treading carefully, NYT’s Nicholas Fandos and Benjamin Oreskes report. Nevertheless: Adams’ administration is working on a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of FEMA funds for migrant housing, POLITICO’s Emily Ngo reports.

THE PURGE: Trump’s mass layoffs of federal workers are here — with the potential to transform many agencies and soon affect ordinary Americans. For Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE, it’s a necessarily radical approach to finally effect real change in reining in the government. But the civil service is stunned and angry at the slash-and-burn. The big picture: More than 14,000 employees were axed, on top of the roughly 75,000 who’ve opted for the “buyout” offer, per WaPo’s Hannah Natanson, Emily Davies, Lisa Rein and Rachel Siegel. So far, the firings mostly hit probationary (new) staffers at the Interior, Energy, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and HHS departments, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration. One source tells POLITICO’s Liz Crampton, Marcia Brown, Danny Nguyen, Ben Lefebvre, Catherine Morehouse and Eric Bazail-Eimil that up to 200,000 probationary employees could be cut ultimately, and some career and comms staffers were given pink slips too. National Archives: Top leaders are being pushed out in a significant disruption at the agency Trump has long blamed for his classified documents case, CNN’s Jamie Gangel reports. “The exodus of senior staff is seen as a huge loss for the agency, which is considered nonpartisan.” Health: HHS fired roughly 2,000 workers, plus another nearly 1,400 at the CDC. On top of civil servants who took the “buyout,” that means about one-tenth of staff gone at the outbreak-prevention agency. Public health officials fear that “the first line of defense in an infectious disease outbreak” will be slashed, NYT’s Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports. But the administration emphasized that the cuts here were much more careful and targeted than at other agencies, POLITICO’s Megan Messerly and Adam Cancryn reports. Interior: 2,300 people were let go, including roughly 780 to 1,000 at the National Park Service, which could cause cancellations and closures at national parks as soon as this week. But the Park Service is reviving about 5,000 job offers to seasonal employees that were yanked last month, per WaPo’s Maxine Joselow. 800 could be ousted at the Bureau of Land Management. Energy: Between 1,000 and 2,000 employees were axed, including 325 at the National Nuclear Safety Administration employees. But by yesterday, some of those firings were already being rescinded for crucial specialists who help maintain the country’s nuclear weapons, Bloomberg’s Ari Natter reports. In fact, some sources told CNN’s Rene Marsh and Ella Nilsen that Trump officials “did not seem to know this agency oversees America’s nuclear weapons.” The Energy Department disputed the number of firings, saying it was only a few dozen at NNSA. Up next: Thousands are expected to be cut next week at the IRS, NYT’s Andrew Duehren and Alan Rappeport scooped. And HUD is bracing for thousands of layoffs — as much as half of the workforce — as DOGE zeroes in on the housing agency, POLITICO’s Mohar Chatterjee, Sophia Cai and Sam Sutton report. Plus: 388 people got the boot at the EPA, per Bloomberg’s Ari Natter. … 3,400 positions will be cut at the Forest Service, potentially limiting wildfire prevention. … 1,000 people were cut at the VA, per the AP. But but but: The CFPB was temporarily blocked from most layoffs, a federal judge ordered yesterday, per POLITICO’s Michael Stratford. Judge Amy Berman Jackson also prevented the administration from destroying the consumer protection agency’s data and barred acting head Russell Vought from defunding it. And at USAID, just seven employees opted in to the “buyouts,” POLITICO’s Daniel Lippman and Carmen Paun scooped for Pros. The fallout: The overall deficit impact of the workforce cuts will be minimal. But if public services start to take a hit across the country, the Trump administration could face a political backlash. Though the D.C. area will be especially affected by layoffs, the jobs are spread across many congressional districts of all persuasions, WSJ’s John McCormick and Max Rust show. The backlash: A number of congressional Republicans have already started to protest specific concerns, from Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho) on the Park Service to Sen. Jerry Moran (Kan.) on USAID to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) on scientific research funding, POLITICO’s Ben Leonard and Hailey Fuchs report. And Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) posted a sharp criticism on X last night, saying she shares Trump’s goal of cutting waste but that the indiscriminate cuts are “bringing confusion, anxiety, and now trauma to our civil servants.” The administration’s response to her staff’s concerns “has been evasive and inadequate,” she added. The backlash to the backlash: The Trump administration has reacted to furor over funding cuts with essentially an eye roll, saying Trump campaigned on this and they don’t care about the upheaval, WaPo’s Natalie Allison and Dan Diamond report. One White House official dismisses the excessive focus on “the one starving kid in Sudan that isn’t going to have a USAID bottle.” Join POLITICO on February 19, for the Playbook First 100 Days: Health Care Breakfast Briefing where we will gather key leaders in health care and Washington to discuss the looming issues that will shape health care policy in 2025. RVSP to attend. 3. WATCHING THE WATCHMEN: A federal judge yesterday tore into the esteemed attorney for IGs fired last month by Trump, accusing them of making strained, ill-considered demands that she reinstate them on an emergency basis — even though they waited nearly three weeks to go to court in the first place, Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney write in. About time: U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes suggested the request — and what she said was an inaccurate comparison to another lawsuit brought by a fired executive branch official — could warrant sanctions. She said it was “totally unacceptable” that the IGs took so long to seek relief then forced a mad rush to the courthouse for emergency action. “They were fired by Mr. Trump on Jan. 24, 2025. If I look at my calendar, I will find that the day is Feb. 14, 2025. … It took you 21 days to file” for a restraining order, Reyes said to attorney Seth Waxman. The threat: During the 12-minute Zoom hearing, Reyes — a Biden appointee — repeatedly threatened that if Waxman continued to seek emergency relief, she’d begin the process to impose sanctions for filing a frivolous pleading with the court. Not the same: While Waxman argued in a court filing that the IGs’ case was “extremely similar” to one where special counsel Hampton Dellinger won temporary restoration to his position after being fired by Trump, Reyes said the cases are “incredibly dissimilar,” citing a slew of differences. “The fact that you all compared this case on the facts to the Dellinger case is beyond comprehension to me,” Reyes said. When Reyes gave the Justice Department lawyers involved a chance to speak, they — perhaps wisely — declined. What’s next: The judge ultimately ordered the government to respond by Friday, which still puts the case on an expedited timetable. Waxman, who was the U.S. government’s top lawyer at the Supreme Court from 1996 to 2001, declined to comment to POLITICO on the episode. 4. MORE FROM THE COURTS: A federal judge paused Trump’s effort to bar federal funding for people 18 and under to get gender transition-related medical care, per The Seattle Times’ Elise Takahama. … Another federal judge decided for now not to bar DOGE from accessing HHS, Labor Department and CFPB data, though he expressed major privacy concerns as the case proceeds, per NYT’s Chris Cameron. … Musk’s government position is the target of two new lawsuits alleging that his massive power is unconstitutional, POLITICO’s Kyle Cheney reports. 5. TRADE WARS: “Trump Says New Tariffs on Autos Coming Around April 2,” by Bloomberg’s Jennifer Dlouhy: “The auto threat offers to put some of the biggest brands in Japan, Germany and South Korea in Trump’s crosshairs. … Trump on Friday did not provide any details on the scope or rate of the potential auto levies. It is also unclear the impact they would have on vehicles built under a free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.” 6. CLIMATE FILES: “Trump Maneuvers to Outflank California Over Ban on Gasoline Cars,” by Bloomberg’s Jennifer Dlouhy: “Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Friday he would formally subject the EPA’s approval of those California rules to congressional scrutiny, opening the door for lawmakers’ expedited repeal of the authorizations. … At issue are EPA decisions under former President Joe Biden to authorize three California car pollution regulations — including measures governing cars and heavy-duty engines.” 7. THE LATEST EXECUTIVE ORDER: Trump yesterday barred federal funding to schools and educational agencies that require Covid-19 vaccination, as Breitbart’s Nick Gilbertson scooped. HHS and the Education Department are tasked with ending such mandates. But the order may be largely symbolic, as few schools have such requirements now and many states have already banned them. 8. IMMIGRATION FILES: “Trump Administration Toughens Rules for Release of Migrant Children,” by NYT’s Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Hamed Aleaziz: The change “could make it more difficult for minors who cross the border alone to be released from federal custody and united with family members in the United States. The policy is similar to one imposed during the first Trump administration, which sought to tighten the vetting process for those living with migrant children.” 9. IN THE DARK: “Urgent CDC Data and Analyses on Influenza and Bird Flu Go Missing as Outbreaks Escalate,” by KFF Health News’ Amy Maxmen: “CDC analyses that would inform people about these situations are delayed, and the CDC has cut off communication with doctors, researchers, and the World Health Organization … A critical analysis of the seasonal flu selected for distribution through the CDC’s Health Alert Network has stalled … A chart from that analysis, reviewed by KFF Health News, suggests that flu may be at a record high.” A message from the Coalition for Medicare Choices: Advertisement Image CLICKER — “The nation’s cartoonists on the week in politics,” edited by Matt Wuerker — 16 funnies A political cartoon is pictured.

The Verge,Theverge,"February 15, 2025","Tech / Command Line The AI spending frenzy is just getting started Project Stargate kicks off a fresh wave of tech CEO chest-thumping. Plus: My conversation with the CEO of Reddit. byAlex Heath Jan 25, 2025, 12:15 AM UTC Digital photo collage of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, Oracle CTO Larry Ellison (R), and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son (2nd-R). Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images Alex Heath Alex Heathis a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has been reporting on the tech industry for more than a decade. “All I know is I’m good for my $80 billion.” Rarely does a one-liner so perfectly capture the state of the moment. Here, you have Microsoft CEO Satya Nadellasaying he’s “not in the details” about Stargate, the supposedly multi-hundred-billion AI infrastructure project driven by his marquee investment, OpenAI. Nadella not being read in on the nebulous details of Stargate says a lot about how much Microsoft and OpenAI have drifted apart. Microsoft is mentioned in the Stargate press release since OpenAI’s models are still exclusive to Azure. But the most striking aspect of Stargate is not that the money isn’t there for it yet; it’s that OpenAI’s biggest backer has decided to not participate in what Sam Altman is calling “the most important project of this era.” As Nadella made clear on CNBC this week, he’s running his own, $80 billion AI infrastructure buildout and, going forward, OpenAI can get additional compute — with his blessing — elsewhere. While it received fewer headlines this week, I found Nadella’s response to Elon Musk on X even more illuminating. In his response to Musk saying, “on the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money,” Nadella responded: “😂 And all this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” That post can only be interpreted as a dig at Altman. Nadella could have funded Stargate for OpenAI. He didn’t. What does he know that the rest of us don’t? The splashy Stargate unveiling at the White House certainly accomplished its goal, which was clearly getting everyone to talk about big numbers. The headlines it generated prompted Mark Zuckerbergto make sure everyone ended the week knowing his data center will be even bigger than Stargate. In a Friday post on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said that Meta’s planned 2GW data center in Louisiana “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” with a map view of the square footage overlaid on the city to send the point home. From his post (my emphasis added): “We’ll bring online ~1GW of compute in ‘25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.” I have no doubt that Altman, Masayoshi Son, and Larry Ellison will be able to raise the billions they need to lessen OpenAI’s dependence on Microsoft for compute. (The US government isn’t giving money to Stargate, which makes the optics of announcing it alongside Trump all the more bizarre.) Ultimately, this all points to the theme that is quickly coming to define 2025: Big Tech sees AI as the most existential technology of the coming era and will keep spending like hell to make sure OpenAI doesn’t completely run away with it. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman Steve Huffman,Illustration by William Joel / The Verge | Photo by Greg Doherty/Variety via Getty Images AMA with spez Few companies had as good of a 2024 as Reddit. Since going public last March, the company’s stock has soared 300 percent, giving the social network a valuation of $32 billion. It’s an about-face from where Reddit was before going public, when its moderators were raging against its hurried platform changes and there was backlash to the company selling its data to Google and OpenAI. With those controversies now seemingly in the rear-view mirror, Reddit is focused on growing its user base, staying profitable, and using AI to help people search its site more easily. I caught up with CEO Steve Huffman at CES a few weeks ago to hear his priorities for 2025, how he’s leading Reddit, his thoughts on the AI scaling debate, content moderation, and more… The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: Your IPO did very well. What have the last nine months or so been like for you personally? We have a saying at Reddit that good numbers make good meetings. So we’ve had some good meetings. Preparing to go public was intense. It’s telling the story over and over and over, which I enjoy doing, but it’s a lot of work. I think more than most new companies, we are in the public company rhythm already: close the quarter, do the audits, do the board meeting, earnings, and all of that. So it hasn’t been a major change for us from an operating point of view. It’s a really exciting time for the new investors and employees. You won’t catch us complaining. What I keep telling the company is that everyone should be very proud of the work they’ve done and don’t take these moments for granted. I just tell them, look, enjoy the view. If you look at our history, there are lots of ups and downs. No doubt there are challenges in our future. With your market cap where it is now, are you thinking of making swings you didn’t think you could make a year ago? There are two classes of things that we would do. One is to execute the core strategy. We’ve got to hire. We’ve got to build. I think we’re very reasonable in terms of our investment size. The one sentence strategy for us is to grow the product and stay profitable. What can you do with a high stock price? Maybe you can look at M&A that you wouldn’t otherwise. I’d say that’s not really our orientation right now because the acquisitions we’ve done over the last two years have been these 25-to-50-million-dollar deals. It’s kind of a sweet spot for us to get tech and teams. I’d say we’re always watching the market, but we’re not pursuing anything big or crazy right now because I like the core strategy. I think we can do what we want to do within our current capabilities. What’s the main product focus for Reddit this year? The first is the core of Reddit, which is community conversations. Everyone has a home on Reddit, but do you see that home in your first session? There’s a whole other dimension to our work, which is Reddit as an information source. Reddit has all of this incredible information. For the users who have a question that needs an answer, can we give them that answer? We just got into testing Reddit Answers. I’m finding that really helpful for searches about current events. A year from now, it’s a monetization product. It’s one of the few products where it kind of scratches every itch, so it’ll be a big focus. What do you make of this debate about whether the AI industry has run out of data? I think we’d have a different answer to that question literally every month. We want to have good relationships with other people in this space. We’re open for business. At the same time, we want to maximize the value we get out of our own data. We have not experienced conflict between the two at this point. I love the [data licensing] relationships we have — the major ones being Google and OpenAI. At this point, we don’t need to make any particular partnership. I’d say they’re all nice to have but nothing is existential for us. One of the challenges is that the AI companies don’t know what product they’re building. It’s not a bad thing. They are iterating themselves. ChatGPT itself, the central product in this conversation, was a demo. Then, a year later, it’s the most important piece of enterprise technology on Earth with questionable economics. That makes it very exciting. I don’t think any of these companies would be offended to hear me say that. You were one of the first social media CEOs I saw to be very critical of TikTok. How does a US ban affect Reddit? If you look at Reddit’s traffic graph over the last 19 years, you will not see the rise and fall of any particular platform. I think every content type should work on Reddit. Video on Reddit is largely camera-out — what I’m looking at — as opposed to camera-in, or who am I? That’s social media. I think the ban is the right thing to do for reasons I’ve mentioned that honestly have nothing to do with competition. With Meta’s moderation changes, the broader conversation around social media feels like it’s changing right now. For the last 10 years, people have been talking about whether speech is the problem, which is a crazy thought. You can’t have freedom without speech. I think that detour through questioning and relitigating core values of America, hopefully that era is coming to a close. Are people playing politics? Of course, people always are. On the topic of moderation, we always just try to do things the right way, which, not coincidentally, are aligned with American values. It’s a democratic platform. We believe very much in the power of people and the wisdom of crowds and voting processes. That is Reddit. So I’m glad to see a return to where we have been most of my life, which is an appreciation for free speech.",Tech,l3kj32ji

Thanks to all the early question-askers (hit me up on askmat(at)engadget.com), including a timely question in the face of new Apple hardware. From Matt Ali: What’s the cheapest way to get an iPad? And which one should I get in early 2025? Instead of doing my own research or asking unhinged AI chatbots, I tapped our iPad expert (and reviewer), Nathan Ingraham, for an answer: TMA Engadget “Apple hardware is known for being expensive, but the company has a store packed with high-quality refurbished products that can save you some serious cash. I’ve bought many devices there over the years and have never had a problem — everything is in like-new condition and has the same warranty as a brand-new product.” At the time of writing, there are a few good options in Apple’s refurbished store if you want an iPad nearly as capable as the newest models but want to save some cash. If you want the largest screen possible, you can grab a sixth-generation, 12.9-inch iPad Pro with an M2 chip and 256GB of storage for $979. Considering the latest 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1299, this merits consideration — especially if you’re an artist who wants a large canvas. If you don’t need that large screen, consider the fifth-generation iPad Air. For $529, you’ll get an 11-inch display, M1 chip and 256GB of storage. That’s $170 less than the current M2 iPad Air with the same amount of storage. Apple’s standard iPad is also available refurbished, but you can often find a brand-new version of it on sale on Amazon. Between that and the rumors of a new basic iPad coming this spring, I’d avoid this one, for now. If you want to upgrade the storage or get a model with cellular connectivity, that should also be doable for extra cash. For me, 256GB or 512GB is the sweet spot for storage — given the ubiquity of the cloud, having a ton of local storage doesn’t feel particularly necessary. Similarly, cellular connectivity is probably not worth the extra cash unless you plan to travel with your iPad. Most of the time, you can easily tether an iPad to your phone if you need to get online quickly. But, those refurb options are available if you want them.” Thanks Nate! Other tech dilemmas?

Deals The best President's Day tech deals on Apple, Samsung, Dyson, Blink and more We scoured the web to find the best President's Day sales on the tech we recommend. Amy Skorheim amy skorheim Senior Reporter, Buying Advice Sat, Feb 15, 2025, 6:00 AM PST Billy Steele/Engadget Presidents’ Day typically brings discounts on mattresses and appliances more so than consumer tech. But every year, there are a few standouts in the areas Engadget knows best like smartphones, tablets, earbuds and more. This year is no different; notably, Presidents' Day deals include $50 off an annual subscription to Peacock Premium, and get the best price on the AirPods Pro 2 that we’ve seen since the holidays last year. If you want to get a jump-start on spring cleaning, iRobot and Dyson deals can help with that, and there are a number of discounts on Blink security cameras at the moment. These are the best Presidents’ Day deals we found on tech for 2025. Spotlight President's Day deal Image for the large product moduleBilly Steele for Engadget Apple AirPods Pro 2 $169$249Save $80 Everyone's favorite buds (seriously, people buy a lot of these things) fell to a record low of $154 for Black Friday, but this is the best price we've seen this year. They're a little older at this point, debuting in 2022, but they're still our favorite wireless earbuds for iPhone. Engadget's Billy Steele gave them a score of 88 in his review when the buds first came out, citing the fantastic sound and amazing transparency mode. $169 at Amazon The best President's Day tech deals A tablet resting against books. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget Apple iPad mini for $499 at Amazon ($100 off): Apple’s smallest tablet was updated in October and got a new A17 Pro chip, which Engadget's Nathan Ingraham found to be plenty fast for anything you'd want to do with the mini — casual browsing, couch binging, game playing and email checking. He gave it an overall score of 83 in our official review and particularly enjoyed it as a Balatro machine. It's also our favorite (partly because it's the only) small iPad on our list of the best iPads. Apple AirPods 4 for $100 at Amazon ($29 off): Apple's newest wireless earbuds came out in September and last week, they hit their lowest price yet. That price is still going strong, so you can still pick them up at a discount. Engadget's Billy Steele gave them a review score of 88, saying they sounded clearer and more balanced than most open-back earbuds. Plus you get all the Apple-perks like fast pairing and device switching with other Apple gadgets, hands-free Siri and Find My tracking. Also at Target and Best Buy. There's also a noise-canceling version on sale for $149. Apple MacBook Pro (2024) Desk View on macOS Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple 2024 MacBook Pro M4 for $1400 at Amazon ($199 off with coupon): Apple's latest Pro-model laptop is down to $1,400 at Amazon with a discount and an on-page coupon. The 14-inch MacBook Pro has 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD storage and both the Space Black and Silver colorways are on sale. Engadget's Devindra Hardawar gave the computer a 92 in his review and it's currently Engadget's pick for the best MacBook for creatives. It has a fast M4 chip, long battery life, bright display and Sharp 12MP Center Stage webcam. Apple Studio Display with tilt-adjustable stand for $1,300 at Amazon ($300 off): We appreciated the excellent build quality of Apple's pricey display in our official review, but noted that it's probably only for Apple diehards. Both the standard glass model and the nano-textured glass option are on sale. The Studio Display made our list of the best monitors and has built-in speakers, a 12MP camera, three USB-C ports and a screen with 5K resolution — but a max refresh rate of 60Hz and single-zone backlighting. Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 at Walmart ($10 off): Apple sells too many versions of the Apple Pencil. So we made a guide. The USB-C model works with all current-generation iPads, including the M2 iPad Air, the M4 iPad Pro, the new iPad mini and the 10th generation iPad. It'll also work with a few older tablets too. Just note that this one attahced magnetically but doesn't recharge that way, like the other Apple Pencils. And it doesn't have pressure sensitivity. Also at Amazon and Target. A logo. Peacock Peacock Premium (one-year) at Peacock for $30 ($50 off): Here's one from our new streaming deals guide: A year of Peacock's streaming service is $30 if you use the code WINTERSAVINGS at checkout. The code is valid through February 18 and saves you 60 percent off the usual $80 annual fee. Though it's called ""Premium"" it's actually the ad-supported tier (Premium Plus is the ad-free plan but it's not discounted and goes for $140 yearly). Peacock is one of our picks for the best streaming services and has some great original content, including Poker Face, a Twisted Metal adaptation and Mrs. Davis. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16 GB) for $135 at Amazon ($25 off): Our choice for best premium ereader. is the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition that goes for $200 and isn't discounted. The standard Paperwhite, on sale here, is basically the same machine, minus a few (inessential) perks like auto-adjusting front lights, extra storage and wireless charging. This is the lowest price we've tracked this year (it went about $5 lower for Black Friday) on a very lovely e-reader with remarkably fast page turns, a super crisp display and a great battery life. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition (32 GB) for $230 at Amazon ($50 off): Engadget's Valentina Palladino found a lot to like about the Kindle Colorsoft in her review including quick page turns, the fairly accurate (if a bit cold) color technology and the pinch to zoom feature, which was especially nice for reading comics. If you're just looking to read black and white text, you can save yourself a bit of money and go with the Paperwhite — text on the Colorsoft is not as crisp. KitchenAid Artisan Series 5 quart tilt head stand mixer for $350 at Amazon ($100 off): One of our top picks for kitchen tech is, unsurprisingly, KitchenAid's famed stand mixer. It's not only powerful, the seemingly endless array of available attachments make it a true kitchen multitasker. KitchenAid is hosting a larger sale for President's Day on its own website, and many of the brand's countertop appliances are currently up to $100 off. iRobot Roomba Combo 10 Max for $789 at Wellbots ($610 off with code): Wellbots has a few iRobot vacuums on sale for President's Day, including the new Roomba Combo 10 Max and its Autowash Dock, which can empty and cleans the vac. Right now it's on sale for $789 if you use the code ENGAD410 at checkout. That'll take a full $610 off the hefty $1,399 MSRP. That's even cheaper than the last time it was on sale. Not only does the robot itself mop and vacuum, the dock can hold 60 days worth of dust and seven days worth of dirty mop water. For a slightly cheaper combo robo vac, Wellbots is also discounting the Roomba Combo j5 for $239 instead of the full $529 with the code ENGAD210. Dyson V12 vaccuum for $499 at Dyson ($150 off): Now through President's Day, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim stick vacuum is $150 off. This is the lighter sibling to the V15 model we picked as the best cordless vac in our guide. This one includes the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that won us over in our testing. It's a hard-floor brush head with a laser ""blade"" that clearly shows you the tiniest bits of dust so you can be sure to suck them up. The Gen5 Outsize Absolute is also on sale for $150 off. It's down to $899. That model is the largest cordless vac and has up to 140 minutes of run time. Samsung Music Frame Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Samsung LS60D Music Frame for $150 at Woot ($250 off): You might be familiar with Samsung's Frame TV — the sets that mimic works of art when you're not watching television. The Music Frame furthers that home-theater-as-decor aesthetic by hiding Dolby Atmos audio equipment behind what looks like a regular picture frame. This one doesn't have a screen, instead you'll insert your own photo or art behind the glass. Inside are two woofers, two tweeters and two mid-range drivers. The speaker array is capable of Dolby Atmos audio and it leverages Samsung's SpaceFit tech to calibrate the sound to the room. We checked it out at CES 2024 and were impressed with how robust the music sounded. Fitbit Charge 6 Fitness Tracker for $116 at Amazon ($44 off): Our current top pick for a fitness tracker is back on sale. It went as low as $100 for Black Friday, but this is the lowest price we've seen this year. Our favorite fitness tracker is the successor to our previous top pick, the Charge 5. This new generation has a more accurate heart rate monitor and the ability to pair with exercise machines via Bluetooth. Plus there's now a physical side button for navigation in addition to the touchscreen. Mill food recycler for $874 at Mill ($125 off): A President's Day sale from Mill, the kitchen food recycling company, will run until Monday, February 17 and will give you $125 off a new food recycling bin. If you've explored the different options for composting food and have decided to give a machine a try, Mill could be a good one to check out. The machine dries and grinds food scraps, reducing odors and bulk while creating grounds that you can add to your garden. A person uses an 8BitDo Pro2 controller to play a game on a Nintendo Switch.~ 8BitDo 8BitDo Pro 2 controller for $39 at Amazon ($12 off): The black version of one of our picks for the best Switch controllers is down to a record-low price. The programmable controller is compatible with the Switch, Apple devices, Android devices, Windows PC, Steam Deck and Raspberry Pi. Blink Mini 2 (2-pack) for $38 at Amazon ($32 off): The Blink Mini 2 security camera sell for $40 each at full price, so this deal gets you two for less than the MSRP for one. The small security cameras have two way talk and listen, capture live video in 1080p and have infrared sensors for black and white images at night. You'll need a Blink Subscription Plan if you want to save clips to the cloud, but if you also buy a Sync Module 2, you can save clips from your Blink Mini cameras to a flash drive. Blink Video Doorbell and Sync Module 2 for $35 ($35 off): Here's a bundle that combines the Video Doorbell with a Sync Module 2, the device that allows you to store footage from your Blink cameras and doorbells locally. The doorbell offers 1080p daytime footage and infrared night video plus two-way audio. You can use it wired or on batteries that should last two years before needing to be replaced. The Blink subscription plan is required if you want person detection and the ability to store clips in the cloud. Ring Battery Video Doorbell for $60 at Amazon ($40 off): Another Amazon security device company, Ring, is also having a sale right now. The discount matches the record-low price for the Ring Video Doorbell. This battery-powered model doesn't need to be wired into your home, so you can put it near any door. The removable battery is rechargeable via USB-C and will likely need a refill every couple months. You'll need a Ring subscription to access all the features, like person and package alerts and extended event history. Apple Music logo on a red background Apple Apple Music (6 months) for $3 at Apple ($60 off): Normally an Apple Music subscription is $11 per month after a 30-day free trial. And when you buy a new Apple device, you usually get a three-month trial. But if you somehow haven't yet signed up for the service, this promotion applies to you. The deal will run through February 27 and is open only to people who are entirely new Apple Music — current and previous customers are not eligible, nor are those who qualify for the free trial that comes with a new device. You'll need to redeem the offer through an iPhone, iPad or Mac. Apple Music made our guide to the best music streaming services for its lossless streaming quality, ease of use with Apple devices and emphasis on using DJ curation over AI and algorithm playlists. Note that the subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel. NordPass Premium (27 months) for $35 at Nord ($46 off): One of our favorite password managers for cross-platform availability is having a sale. NordPass Premium is currently available for $35 for 27 months. At full price, two years would cost you $81, and this deal throws in three months for free. NordPass also offers a free tier, but the Premium plan keeps you logged in when you switch devices while also helping you analyze your passwords to improve their strength. EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra for $5,299 at EcoFlow ($797 off): The whole-home backup battery and inverter from EcoFlow is on sale for a Valentine's Day/President's Day sale at the manufacturer's site. Samsung Evo Select (1TB) microSD card for $70 at Amazon ($10 off): The Evo Select is the budget pick in our guide to the best microSD cards: It's not the fastest model we tested, but it'll serve as a way to add storage for your Nintendo Switch or Android tablet. This deal matches the all-time low for the extra-spacious 1TB model. Also at Samsung and B&H. iRobot Roomba Vac Robot Vacuum (Q0120). Roomba iRobot Roomba Vac Essential (Q0120) for $119 at Amazon ($130 off): The top pick in our guide to the best budget robot vacuums has hit a new low price. It can't map paths in your home, instead it randomly traverses a room until it's covered the area. But it has good suction and cleans well, plus it's easy to set up and control through Roomba's mobile app. Also at Best Buy and Target. LG B4 OLED TV (48"") for $600 at Best Buy ($200 off): This ties the lowest price we've seen for the 48-inch LG B4, which is the entry-level model in LG's 2024 OLED lineup. While it's not as bright or color-rich as some higher-end alternatives, it still offers the essential perks of any good OLED TV: superb contrast with deep black tones, clear motion, wide viewing angles and the like. It's also a nice value for gaming, as it has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support refresh rates up to 120Hz. It's just better off in a darker room, and this particular model is relatively small.

Karissa Bell karissa bell Senior Editor Updated Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 6:11 PM PST·1 min read 1 NurPhoto via Getty Images TikTok is once again available in Apple’s App Store and Google's Play Store in the United States. The app disappeared from both Apple and Google’s stores January 19, 2025, as a nationwide ban briefly took effect. But though the app’s service was quickly restored after President Donald Trump promised not to enforce the ban, the app had remained unavailable for download in US app stores. Apple has now reversed course. Bloomberg reported the company made the decision after a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Trump previously told the Justice Department in an executive order to delay enforcing a ban for 75 days. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok is now also officially available in Google’s Play Store, after the company encouraged Android users to sideload the app. According to Axios, Google was assured by the Justice Department that restoring people's access to TikTok wouldn't violate the law. It’s still not clear what will ultimately happen to TikTok longterm. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to strike a “deal” that will allow the company to remain operational in the US, including arrangements that would give the US government a stake in the company. A number of investors and companies have also proposed offers to take over some aspect of TikTok, though the company hasn’t indicated which bids it might be taking seriously.

Lawrence Bonk lawrence bonk Contributing Reporter Wed, Feb 12, 2025, 12:00 PM PST·2 min read 1 Apple After years of waiting, the Apple TV app is finally available natively on Android devices. This version was “built from the ground up” to take advantage of the Android operating system and is currently ready for download from the Google Play Store. It was designed for smartphones, tablets and foldables. This is a full version of the app, with all of the stuff Apple users have come to expect. There’s a feature for picking up a show where you left off and a tool for downloading content to watch offline. It works via Wi-Fi or cellular. The app allows access to Apple TV+ content, so you can finally watch the absolute boatload of original shows the platform pumps out. It’s a veritable cornucopia of sci-fi goodness, with hit shows like Severance, Silo and For All Mankind. The platform also airs non-genre fare like Ted Lasso, Shrinking and Slow Horses. New users get a free seven-day trial to the platform. Otherwise, pricing is the same as always and folks can sign up for subscriptions via Google Play. The app even grants access to MLS Season Pass content, just in time for Major League Soccer’s 2025 season. Sports fans can also check out a weekly MLB double-header each Friday with no local restrictions. There have been workarounds to get Apple TV content on Android devices. In the past, users were forced to enter credentials via the web app or use a Prime Video bundle. Android TVs have long had a dedicated Apple TV app, but there was no way to subscribe on the television itself. That also changed today, as Google Play now offers the ability to subscribe on Android TVs. There’s no casting support on this first version of the app, but we hope it’ll come soon via a future update. The Apple TV app only works on devices running Android 10 or later.

Kris Holt kris holt Contributing Reporter Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:20 AM PST·1 min read 8 Reuters / Reuters It seems Apple is ready to show off something new. In a tweet on Thursday, CEO Tim Cook told Apple aficionados to ""get ready to meet the newest member of the family."" What that product is remains a slight mystery, though we won't have to wait too long to find out what Apple has up its sleeve. The reveal will take place on Wednesday, February 19. In case there was any ambiguity, Cook's tweet included an #AppleLaunch hashtag. Cook's tweet also featured an animated image of a shimmering Apple logo on what appears to be the outline of an AirTag. It's been rumored for a while that Apple would introduce a second-gen tracker sometime this year. The purported AirTag 2 is expected to have a longer range and a speaker that's more difficult to remove, as well as Apple Vision Pro integration. In addition, reports suggest that Apple will reveal a new iPhone SE very soon. The unveiling was initially believed to be happening sometime this week. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said on Tuesday that the ""new iPhone SE is still imminent and should be announced by next week, when the company is holding product briefings."" He added that an Apple Vision Pro announcement appears to be in the offing, while the M4-powered MacBook Air is slated to arrive ""within weeks."" It seems that Apple has a lot of irons in the fire at the minute. As such, the company has a bunch of different options for what to reveal next week. Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesDAAPrivacyRightIcon CA Privacy Notice About Our Ads Apps Apple and Google adopt Gulf of America for US Maps users Google Maps still labels the body of water as Gulf of Mexico in Mexico. Mariella Moon mariella moon Contributing Reporter Updated Tue, Feb 11, 2025, 2:37 PM PST·2 min read 59 REUTERS / Reuters Google Maps now officially shows the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America if you open the app in the US. In a blog post, Google said it rolled out the named change because the government has already updated the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), which decides the ""federal and national standard for geographic nomenclature."" One of the executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January when he took office renames the body of water, but Google previously explained that it's the company's longstanding policy to wait for official government resources to be updated before applying any name change. The Gulf of America label will only be visible if you use the Maps app in the US, or if you open Maps on the web and your device's location is set to the region. If you're in Mexico, the label still shows Gulf of Mexico. And if you're elsewhere, you'll see it marked as both, specifically: Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America). It's also longstanding policy for the company to show official local names when they vary between countries. Trump's executive order also renames Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. So far, the location is still being shown as Denali on Maps. Google Maps Google Separately, Apple updated its Maps application and website to include the new nomenclature for US users. At present, the company's map graphics still display ""Gulf of Mexico,"" but clicking on the region brings up a card that says ""Gulf of America."" Searching for ""Gulf of Mexico"" brings up the same GoA card. According to Bloomberg, Apple won't limit this change to only the US. The news org, paraphrasing Apple, said that the company will ""soon roll out the shift for all users globally."" We have reached out to Apple to confirm that users worldwide, including those in Mexico, will see Gulf of America on the company's maps. A Congressional Research Service report on how and where geographical name changes apply specifically says that ""private companies such as Google Maps and Apple Maps"" would be unaffected by President Trump's Executive Order. The report also notes that decisions from the US Board on Geographic Names, which was responsible for actioning the name change, only apply to federal use. Update, February 11, 5:35PM ET: This story and its headline were updated to reflect Apple's decision to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its Maps application. Additional context on geographical name changes from a Congressional Research Service report was also added.

Will Shanklin will shanklin Contributing Reporter Fri, Feb 14, 2025, 1:28 PM PST·1 min read Reddit / u/iron_cam86 Breaking: Netflix made an oopsie. On Thursday, word spread online that some of its content began appearing in the Apple TV app. The lack of an official announcement (and extremely buggy nature) of the integration was enough to cast doubt on the news. But that didn't stop users from rejoicing and sharing ""FINALLY!"" GIFs on social media. Unfortunately, your triumphant festivities weren't warranted, as the company has said it was unintentional. A Netflix spokesperson told The Verge on Friday that the Apple TV app integration was an error that has been rolled back. Indeed, Redditors who had been tracking the forbidden fruit with unbridled glee confirmed that all signs of Netflix content had since vanished from Apple's streaming hub. Netflix giveth, and Netflix taketh away. While the boo-boo was still active, PC World reported it let you add Netflix originals like Stranger Things, Cobra Kai and The Crown but lacked licensed shows and movies. Even the available content was a buggy mess. For example, only season five of The Crown was available, leaving you to wonder what hijinks Liz and the gang had gotten into before or after the grunge era. The ""Add to Watchlist"" and ""Continue Watching"" features were also said to be spotty. It's easy to speculate that such a glitch was tied to internal testing accidentally made public, but there's no reason to assume that's anything but wishful thinking. At least for now, you'll have to watch Netflix content in the Netflix app, leaving Apple’s for a well-earned rewatch of The Sopranos (via Max), The Bear (via Hulu) and Apple's own Silo.

Sportsletter,Sportsletter,"February 15, 2025","NBA All-30: Everybody Plays 02/13/2025 By: Jeff Yoder Good Morning! We’ve got bargain basketball. All 30 NBA teams were in action on the same night — a rarity that only occurs a few times a year. Four guys went for 40-plus (KAT, Kyrie Irving, Jordan Poole and Jamal Murray). That’s one short of the NBA record for the most 40-pieces in one day. There were also goals aplenty in the NHL’s 4 Nations showdown and the Champions League. Another MLB free agent is off the board, too. Letter Rip! ______________________________________________________________________________________ NBA All-30: NBA for Everybody Photo: Aaron Ontiveroz / Getty Images Jamal Murray’s 55 Points, Kyrie Irving’s 3-Point Barrage, Knicks-Hawks Chaos & More From an All-30 Night in the NBA Fifteen games in one night? Yes, please. The perfect way to transition into NBA All-Star Weekend was an all-30 night of NBA action. Fifteen games featuring every team meant six-plus hours of hoops highlights across the country. There were four 40-point scorers; just one short of the NBA record for most in one night. Here are the top stories from a special evening in the Association: Jamal Murray Notches Career-High 55 Have a night, Mr. Murray! The Nuggets’ star guard hung a career-high 55 on the Blazers in a win (132-121). Murray hit seven 3s (20-for-36 FG). It’s his fourth career 50-point game. Kyrie Irving Catches Fire From 3 The short-handed Mavericks welcomed the Warriors to Dallas, and it was the Kyrie Irving show in the second half. Kyrie (42 points) went 7-for-10 from 3, including a stretch of four straight in the 4th quarter. Dallas won (111-107). Knicks-Hawks Classic at MSG The Hawks and Knicks battled into the night at MSG with one of the most exciting finishes of the season. All the stars showed out — Karl-Anthony Towns (44 pts), Jalen Brunson (36 pts), Trae Young (38 points). Atlanta rallied in the 4th, but Brunson hit the game-winner with 11 seconds left in OT (Knicks win, 149-148, OT). Bronny’s New Career-High The Lakers fell to the Jazz in an awkward night for L.A. (131-119) where Luka Doncic (16 pts) and LeBron James (18 pts) failed to crack 20. One silver lining was Bronny James’ career-high 9 points (Two 3s) in just eight minutes. Kevin Durant’s 30K Encore KD hit the 30,000-point milestone earlier in the week. He followed it up with 37 last night, but the Suns are in rough shape.

Canada and Sweden dropped the puck on the NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off last night with a thrilling start. The Canadians might have too much firepower for anybody in this thing. Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid is a front line force that might break the brains of hockey fans.

Feyenoord scooped a win over Milan (1-0) thanks a super early goal (3rd minute) that proved to be enough.

Welcome to the new normal. Americans in England: Prior to 2005, there were no American owners in the English Premier League. Two decades later, 10 of the 20 clubs in England's top flight are owned by Americans. Arsenal: Stan Kroenke Aston Villa: Wes Edens Bournemouth: Bill Foley Chelsea: Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital Crystal Palace: John Textor, Josh Harris, David Blitzer Everton: The Friedkin Group Fulham: Shahid Khan Ipswich Town: ORG, BPSP and Avenue Sports Liverpool: Fenway Sports Group Manchester United: The Glazer Family Zoom out: Americans also own nine of the 24 clubs in the EFL Championship (one tier below the Premier League) and roughly one third of all teams in the the country's top four leagues. And it's not just England: U.S.-based owners now control over 20 clubs across Europe's ""Big Five"" leagues, including three of the biggest teams in Italy (Inter Milan, AC Milan, Roma). What's driving this trend? Part of the appeal of European soccer clubs is the lower valuations compared to equivalent assets in the U.S. The ""promotion"" system is also a draw for investment-minded owners, who can essentially buy the equivalent of a Triple-A baseball team and generate huge returns if they make it to the big leagues.

It is from a parents’ evening when he was 16 and the headteacher told his mother and father that he should leave school as he was not academic enough. “The next day I said to myself ‘I’m not going to be beaten’,” Levy says. “From that moment onward I got As in my exams and I went to university. I’m a fighter.” It is a tale that Levy recalls to Tanguy Ndombele in the Amazon Prime All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur series, as the pair talk about the (disastrous) record signing’s struggles at the club. And, tellingly, it is a tale Levy also recounted when he spoke at the Cambridge Union, returning to the university where he gained a first-class degree in Economics and Land Economy. “I had to fight to get to where I am today and everyone said I wouldn’t make it,” Levy told the students. It is even a description that those who know Levy use today. “A lot of people don’t know the real Daniel Levy,” someone who has worked with him for many years told Telegraph Sport. “He looks very tough, very tight, very difficult to deal with and, yes, he’s not easy to deal with. But he’s a good guy. He’s a fighter. Very, very clever and he built this by himself. Joe Lewis invested at the start but since then he has not put money into the club. Daniel has done it all.” “This” is the modern-day Tottenham Hotspur that Levy has presided over with their state-of-the-art training ground, the wonderful, futuristic stadium and a club that are now valued at £2.6 billion by Forbes. They were worth £80 million when he took over. But, also, do not forget the underperforming football team, sky-high season-ticket prices and unhappy fanbase. Thinking ‘too big’ In fact there are those who believe Levy has thought “too big” with his off-field ambitions to the detriment of what it is ultimately all about: the football. He maintains those ambitions are to help fund the club although he is also the highest-paid executive in the Premier League (£6.58 million a year in the last accounts) and is ranked 303rd on The Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £450 million. The latest plan is to build a 30-storey hotel with 180 rooms and 49 apartments adjacent to the stadium, which is due to open before Euro 2028. Lewis is, of course, the English billionaire tax exile. He was the ultimate owner of ENIC and, therefore, Tottenham, who were acquired by the investment company in 2001 but since 2022 it has been in the hands of the Lewis Family Trust, which retains his name although he is no longer part of it. Lewis, or the trust, was never prepared to inject cash into the club after that initial outlay. Levy’s goal, therefore, was always for it to be self-sustaining. Given his longevity – he celebrates the 24th anniversary of his appointment next month, making him by far the Premier League’s longest-serving chairman – and the infrastructure he has built without risking Spurs’ financial security, Levy should be hugely popular and celebrated. Daniel Levy shakes hands with the King Levy welcomed the King to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the stunning development that has boosted Spurs’ worth, on Wednesday - Getty Images/Eddie Mulholland Instead he will face more furious protests about his chairmanship after Sunday’s home game against Manchester United with fans urged to take part in a sit-in. Last weekend, during the FA Cup defeat away to Aston Villa, the frustrated Spurs supporters maligned the chairman’s name throughout, both in a chant celebrating Dejan Kulusevski and the simple “We want Levy out”. Ahead of the game against Leicester City last month a banner was unfurled which read: “24 years, 16 managers, one trophy. Time for change”. The involvement with Lewis stems from Levy’s business background, running ENIC. Levy, who has been managing director since 1995, even refers to him as “Mr Lewis”. Despite the apparent portrayal of himself as fighting against the odds, Levy’s is hardly a story of hardship and battling his way up. He went to state school but there was already a successful family business, begun by his grandfather, Abraham, who opened a hat shop in Stratford, east London, which Levy’s father Barry diversified into men’s clothes including the Mr Byrite brand, later the retail chain Blue Inc. Still the outsider Even so, Levy’s words about himself reveal an attitude that has influenced him throughout his career. For good and bad. It explains, in particular, why he never wants to lose face when it comes to transfer deals and why he has acted as something of an outsider despite how long he has been a fixture in the Premier League. “There are chips on his shoulder that come from somewhere,” says a former business associate who admires Levy’s drive and acumen but is less enamoured with his man-management and personality, describing how he runs Spurs “like an investment bank” with targets and KPIs – Key Performance Indicators – to be met. Former staff complain that even if they reached these targets they were left feeling it was not enough. Man-management, they say, is certainly not a strength of Levy’s. Interestingly, “not good enough” is another theme that resonates with him personally. Five years ago Levy granted a rare interview to the Cambridge student newspaper Varsity in which he admitted he feared that he had failed his university finals, despite “working every hour in the last few months” because – tellingly – he thought “I just wasn’t good enough”. When he went to check which degree classification he had, he started reading the list from the bottom, where students failed or were awarded thirds. Boasting about a thick skin Being a fighter. Proving people wrong. Not losing face. Winning the deal. Coming out on top. Earning respect – and money – while claiming he does not care what people think of him. Boasting, apparently, about having a thick skin. All this matters to Levy and helps to explain his way of operating and his motivation. And so Telegraph Sport has spoken to a number of people who know the 63-year-old – from former employees, business associates, club executives and agents – all on the basis of anonymity to try to build a picture of what he is like. And there is that word, above all, that is used to describe Levy. By those who like him and also by those who are not so warm towards him. “He is a fighter,” says another long-time associate who has known Levy for many years and who cites the transfer of Harry Kane to Bayern Munich as not just his best deal but one that sums up the way he operates and why he always tries to do what he believes is in Spurs’ interests. However unpopular it makes him. Harry Kane signs for Bayern Munich Harry Kane’s transfer to Bayern Munich epitomised Levy’s modus operandi - Getty Images/Christian Kaspar-Bartke “A lot of the decisions he makes are not popular but he is genuinely trying to do the best for the football club,” one source maintains. The perspective from Kane’s camp on what happened is very different. It is very similar, in fact, to that of Luka Modric who, like Kane, believed he had a “gentleman’s agreement” with Levy that he could leave. The mistake both made was not to have anything in writing. And, so, when Modric tried to quit for Chelsea for £22 million – in 2011 – and gave an interview to Telegraph Sport asking to go, Levy put out a forthright statement on the club website just a few hours later killing his chances. The Croatian was eventually sold to Real Madrid the following year for £33 million but has not forgotten what happened. And when it came to signing his replacement, João Moutinho, that deal fell apart because of Levy’s 11th-hour haggling over £500,000 on a £26 million transfer which infuriated the then manager André Villas-Boas. Similarly, Kane believed that, in a meeting, Levy had accepted he could leave if Spurs finished outside the top four or failed to win a trophy. He wanted to join Manchester City in 2021. Levy refused, selling him to Bayern Munich two years later for £100 million – which was also the base of City’s offer. For Spurs and Levy it was a great piece of business as Kane, at 30, had just 12 months left on his contract. ‘Near impossible to deal with’ This is where opinions on Levy diverge dramatically. “He’s very hard, to near-impossible to deal with. I’d never try to buy or sell a player to Tottenham,” says one club chairman who also adds that, as a person, he likes Levy, describing him as shy but polite and, one on one, “quite good company” with a sharp sense of humour even if you have to lead any conversation with him. Levy has even been known to perform karaoke, once persuaded to do so during a trip to Moscow for a Europa League tie by Spurs’ former executive director Darren Eales. Levy sang Sir Elton John’s Crocodile Rock. Levy is not anti-social but he can be hard work in a social environment. He appears at his most comfortable firing off emails or WhatsApp messages and he is relentless in doing so, often with bold demands attached. Such as when he wanted to sign Wilfried Zaha in 2016 and tried to low-ball Crystal Palace by getting them to take Ryan Mason… whom he valued at £2 million more. But Levy is not a great public-facing communicator which, sources say, is partly why fans fail to connect with him. Levy and Lewis out banner Not only has Levy failed to connect with Spurs supporters, some of them are in open revolt about the way he has run the club - Getty Images/ Michael Regan When Levy walks into a room he can appear relatively anonymous and unassuming, which is fine. But is it what you want from a leader? Another criticism is that he has not always surrounded himself with people who make up for his weaknesses. Instead they tend to compound them. A former highly placed employee is more withering about this: “If he had been a better football administrator – or employed one and let him get on with the job – then Spurs would be top four. Sometimes it feels like a property company with a football club attached rather than a football club with property.” This is hotly disputed by others who know him, and the accusation offends Levy, who was a Spurs season ticket-holder and is a genuine fan of the club. He gave a presentation to all of Spurs’ 750 staff in which he put up a picture with lots of trophies on it and has admitted to feeling “sick” that Arsenal have had more success. Levy, with just the 2008 League Cup, has vowed he will never leave Spurs without winning something else and Telegraph Sport has been told he has turned down at least three serious takeover approaches in recent years from substantial figures who decided to buy another Premier League club instead. He has claimed to have refused bids from the Far East, Middle East and United States but continues to seek minority investment, recently holding talks with financier Amanda Staveley, who brokered the Saudi Arabian-led purchase of Newcastle United. The Qataris retain an interest in Spurs. Levy’s supporters insist he has one overall aim: to bring success on the pitch. “He cares only about the football and that is the truth and when it comes to football he is better than everybody,” one declares, although he agrees with the view of the chairman we spoke to: some clubs do not want to deal with Levy. “It’s very simple. Always he tries to get more and pay less. It is that simple. Sometimes it’s a crazy number and people look at him like they don’t understand where it came from,” he says. “Some clubs are totally afraid to deal with him because they know he comes again and again and again trying to get what he wants.” There are myriad stories of outrageous demands and near-misses when it comes to buying and selling players – from Eden Hazard and Luis Suárez to more recently Luis Díaz and Conor Gallagher, which some ascribe to Levy’s hard bargaining. He never blinks and he will bombard people with emails and messages trying to get the deal done. Luis Diaz embraces Jurgen Klopp Spurs’ bid for Luis Díaz in January 2022 was rejected by Porto and the forward signed for Liverpool days later - AP Photo/Jon Super Levy has even had to step away and delegate at the last minute – as with Gareth Bale’s £85.5 million world-record sale to Real Madrid – because it got too tense, while there are those who believe his aggressive attitude towards deals is influenced by the fact that he made most of his money in the property boom. “So do you think you’re more painful to deal with than a hip replacement?” asked a student during the Q&A at Cambridge, citing a quote from Sir Alex Ferguson relating to the Dimitar Berbatov deadline-day transfer in 2008. “Maybe,” Levy said, with a smile, although it should also be noted that he and Ferguson remain friends. Even so there are those who say following the Berbatov transfer and, later, after allowing Kyle Walker to join City, Levy vowed never again to sell to the Manchester clubs. It is partly why City were turned down in their attempt to sign Kane and United never really tried to recruit him, despite being desperate to do so on several occasions and knowing he would have joined them. What is not in dispute is Levy’s workaholic nature. He barely sleeps. “Nothing moves at the club without him. He is working 18 hours a day and the only thing in the world for him is Tottenham,” says one associate. The stories are legendary of his obsessive nature: from logging on to the stadium TV webcam through his iPad at 6am every day to watch the progress of the new ground when it was being built and zooming in on anything he was unhappy with, to choosing the tiling for the concourses and going through the wine lists in hospitality. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium being built Levy logged on to a webcam at 6am each morning to monitor the construction of Tottenham’s new stadium - Getty Images/English Heritage/Heritage Images In fact, some at Spurs talk fondly about the period when the stadium was being built and how it distracted Levy and the board away from the actual football. That allowed the then manager Mauricio Pochettino, academy manager John McDermott – now the FA’s technical director – and Steve Hitchen, who was then Tottenham’s performance director, to get on with it. Pochettino was undoubtedly the manager Levy had the best relationship with – the one he invested in the most, personally – and the Argentine brought the most success, including reaching the Champions League final in 2019. Famously, in his autobiography, the former captain Hugo Lloris chided Levy for handing the players luxury watches from IWC Schaffhausen – Spurs’ “official timing partner” – engraved with the word “finalist”. Levy’s motivation? Lloris’s criticism was harsh as apparently lucrative contracts kicked in with Nike and shirt sponsors AIA for reaching the final, and not necessarily winning it, and he wanted to reward the players for that achievement. Instead it reinforced the perception that he was a “numbers man” more concerned with the finance than the football. That is strongly disputed by those who point out that Levy then employed José Mourinho and Antonio Conte, against his usual “project manager” approach, expressly and expensively to win. That did not work either. Tellingly, and despite the team’s struggles, he has stuck with Ange Postecoglou – for now – because he likes him as well as being sympathetic to the factors that have contributed to such a difficult season. Maybe, also, he sees a fellow fighter or, once again, he wants to do things his way. Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But Rodgers reportedly didn't want to move out. Steve Helling and Ryan Dunleavy of the New York Post report that Rodgers ""pleaded"" with the Jets to keep him, and that in the final conversations with the team's new regime ""aggressively urged"" the franchise to give him another year, or even two. In the end he reportedly accepted the decision ""like a man going to the gallows."" We've got no reason to dispute the accuracy of the report. But it sounds out of character for the coolly detached Rodgers to pivot to desperation. He just doesn't seem like the type to ever plead or urge or walk away with his tail tucked between his legs. Implicit in the report is that Rodgers had decided to play in 2025, at least for the Jets. The question now becomes whether he finds a match with another team that might be interested. In the end, that's the question. Will someone else want him? And will he want the team that wants him? With two bad seasons tacked onto a stellar career in Green Bay, Rodgers might not want to play for the sake of playing. He might want to ensure that 2025 will be better than 2023 and 2024. The Steelers continue to make the most sense for Rodgers. First, the Steelers have to decide that Rodgers makes sense for them. If they don't, will he choose to play for a team with a tougher path to contention? Or will he wait for a quarterback on a high-end Super Bowl contender to suffer a season-ending injury? (Even then, said contender might not call.) In the end, his NFL playing career might conclude the same way Bill Belichick's NFL coaching career did. With a whimper fueled by a lack of interest that the man at the center of the discussion will find confounding, but that everyone on the outside will understand. It's well documented that the Aaron Rodgers experience can be exhausting. Do his skills justify the distractions? While he can still play, it's possible that the cons now outweigh any lingering pros.
