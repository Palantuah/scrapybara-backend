the industry last year has finally shown signs of easing, with major
fabrication plants reporting increased production capacity. TSMC's new $12
billion Arizona facility is expected to significantly boost North American
chip production. Meanwhile, AI chip demand continues to surge, with smaller
players like AMD and MediaTek gaining market share in the specialized AI

Wheat futures have jumped 15% following reports of drought conditions in key growing areas of Australia and Argentina.

We're seeing interesting opportunities in agricultural REITs and midstream energy companies that have been overlooked by mainstream investors.""
