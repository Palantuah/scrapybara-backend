"☕ Blue plate special","Morning Brew","February 15, 2025","Good morning. Corporate execs and Mafia bosses can agree on one thing: Gen Z workers put too much emphasis on work-life balance. Giancarlo Romano, the alleged don of Sicily’s notorious Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was recently caught on wiretap complaining about the quality of new recruits, calling the young up-and-comers “miserable.” He grumbled that the organization currently has a fraction of the influence Vito Corleone had in The Godfather, which was based on Cosa Nostra. 

Just wait until he tries to bring them back to the office.

### GOVERNMENT  
# Trump puts defense cuts on the menu  
Yasin Ozturk/Getty Images

President Donald Trump said this week he’ll seek a nuclear weapons deal with US geopolitical foes China and Russia, and that he wants the trio to eventually agree to halve their military spending. 

Achieving such a trilateral agreement is a tall order, but that didn’t stop stocks of companies that supply Uncle Sam with the lethal machinery it uses to fight its adversaries from taking a nosedive at the suggestion.

  * Shares in the largest US military contractor, Lockheed Martin, which got more than $68 billion in Pentagon business in 2023, dropped almost 5% since Trump’s remarks Thursday.
  * Stocks of fellow defense dollar recipients RTX and Northrop Grumman plummeted 4% and 7%, respectively.

But the Department of Defense—which is the federal government’s largest department, with an $800 billion budget—might start tightening its belt long before Trump pitches Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin on a military thriftiness pledge.

## DOGE is knocking at the Pentagon

Trump has reportedly directed the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to scrutinize defense spending. Pentagon officials told NPR they expect DOGE to begin its work there in the coming days and that it’ll target an 8% spending cut.

  * Defense Secretary Hegseth previously suggested that some top-ranking positions might be eliminated as the department reviews the 3 million people it employs in both uniformed and civilian roles.
  * DOGE will also likely audit the equipment the military orders with some services reportedly already floating purchases to cut, per the Wall Street Journal.

Lawmakers and experts of all political stripes have long criticized legacy weapons programs that are plagued with cost overruns and often yield tech of questionable usefulness—with Musk himself recently dunking on the uber-pricey F-35 jets.

But slashing military costs could be politically tricky as defense contractors employ more than 2 million people across the country. Plus, Musk spearheading the effort presents a potential conflict of interest, as SpaceX is itself a Pentagon contractor.

But not the entire weapons business stands to lose: Trump's Pentagon is expected to favor autonomous systems, which could benefit defense startups like the AI company Palantir and the dronemaker Anduril. Palantir shares rose over 6% this week.—SK  

### STAT  
# Prime number: Shopping is dropping  
Sean Justice/Getty Images

If your favorite store clerk isn’t smiling quite as widely as usual when they greet you today, it could be because data released yesterday showed that US retail sales experienced their biggest decline in nearly two years last month. Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January, marking the steepest monthly decrease since March 2023, according to the Commerce Department. The big dip came on the heels of an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in December, the department said.

Why aren’t Americans giving in to their inner shopaholic any more? Part of the reason could simply be seasonality as everyone comes down from their holiday-buying binge. Plus, the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and severe winter storms hitting large swaths of the country might have made getting out to brick-and-mortar stores harder than usual. But with sales going down across nine of the 13 categories tracked—motor vehicles, sporting goods, and furniture fell the most—Bloomberg notes that it could be driven by more than just bad weather as consumers continue to contend with high inflation, which could be a worrying sign for the economy.—AR  

### NEWS  
# What else is brewing  
  * OpenAI’s board unanimously rejected Elon Musk’s unsolicited $97.4 billion offer to buy the ChatGPT-maker, saying the “much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.”

THE BIG IDEA  

## What’s happening with Twitter?  

If you’ve been following the Twitter developments since Friday, then you’re well aware the developments are very much… developing.

At the center of it is Elon Musk and an inner circle working to quickly implement changes to the company and platform.

#### So, what’s happened so far?

First came the sink. Then firing Parag Agrawal, the now-former CEO. Then the firing of “Rahul Ligma” — which, unsurprisingly, was a prank.

Over the weekend, reports continued circulating about potential layoffs, which are now widely expected. Throughout, Musk has tweeted some updates, including plans for the formation of a content moderation council.

Both Musk and friend Jason Calacanis — a VC and Twitter’s self-proclaimed “Chief Meme Officer” — have surveyed users about bringing back Vine, the short-form video app (basically, TikTok before TikTok) that Twitter shut down in 2016.

#### What’s this about charging for verification?

Musk’s team is also revamping Twitter’s verification process, possibly looking to charge $19.99 a month for verification.

It seems unlikely that decision would have a wide-scale fiscal impact, though: In a poll run by Calacanis, 81.5% of ~1.6m users said they wouldn’t pay for verification.

Opinions on the implications of such a move vary:

  * Calacanis contends wide-scale verification is “the quickest way to make the platform safer & more usable.”
  * On the other hand, some experts think charging for verification could lead to an increase in scams and impersonation.

Others have suggested alternative approaches, like charging for *other* features (e.g., video hosting), offering multiple tiers of verification, or charging a smaller amount (say, $5). The situation remains fluid, with Musk indicating that “the entire verification process is being revamped right now.” We’ll see.

CHART  

## Should we be worried about a Phillies World Series title?  

Philadelphia sports fans have a bit of a reputation (see here, here, and here).

While a chaotic, booze-soaked celebration — and a few incidents of rioting and brawling — followed the Eagles’ 2018 Super Bowl victory, something more disruptive could be looming with a Phillies win.

#### All three Philadelphia baseball titles…

… have been followed by a recession, per The Wall Street Journal.

  * In 1929, the Philadelphia Athletics’ championship was followed by the Great Depression.
  * In 1980, the Phillies’ first title was followed by a three-year recession.
  * In 2008, the Phillies’ most recent win was followed by the financial crisis.

Many will still be rooting for them. Their opponent, the Houston Astros, have garnered a reputation as the “new evil empire,” making four World Series in six years, all while battling cheating allegations.

Plus, if a Phillies win is followed by an economic downturn, it’s not like we haven’t been warned already.  

COLOR WARS  

## Pantone colors are disappearing from Adobe  

Things are about to get less colorful for Adobe software users.

Pantone is paywalling 15k colors in products including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign this month, per Vice.

For designers who don’t pay up, some colors will switch to black.

#### What’s a Pantone Color?

In 1963, Pantone developed the Pantone Matching System, which standardizes colors across industries and materials.

For example: You want your business logo to be “Very Peri,” Pantone’s 2022 Color of the Year.

By using Peri’s ID (Pantone 17-3938) when you send your logo to the printer, you can guarantee that exact shade always winds up on your ads and T-shirts.

#### Previously…

… Adobe and Pantone had an agreement in which Adobe paid to license Pantone’s color swatches, or “books,” for use in its software.

But last year, the companies announced that Adobe would remove Pantone’s books, supposedly because they were out of date. (Rumors, however, suggest a disagreement between the companies.)

#### So now…

… people who want to use affected colors must pay $15/mo. for a plug-in, per designer Iain Anderson.

And most users can’t just run an older version that still has the old books because Adobe has switched its software to a cloud-based model.

"Weekly Brief: Central Banks Keep Wishing On Tomorrow, But Inflation’s Got Other Plans","Finimize","November 12, 2021","Recap: 
  * Less than two months ago, the OECD – a major economic organization – said that inflation is here to stay for the next two years 
  * The British central bank said last week that it expects inflation to hit 5% by April next year, up from 3% today 
  * And data out earlier this week showed US inflation hitting its highest level in over thirty years

✍️ Connecting The Dots 

Skyrocketing energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and labor shortages have all conspired to push up the rate of inflation across the developed world. In fact, the Bank of England admitted just last week that it’s expecting inflation to hit 5% by April next year. That’s big: over the past three decades, there’s only been three instances where inflation was 5% or higher. Plus, data out this week showed that US prices of goods and services rose by 6.2% last month versus the same time last year – the fastest annual rise in over thirty years.

For now though, central banks are sticking to their guns, claiming that inflation is just “transitory” due to temporary issues caused by the pandemic and the subsequent recovery. But inflation is looking increasingly less transitory. Six months ago, we saw extreme blips in the prices of goods directly affected by the pandemic, like fuel and cars. And now those effects are waning, sure, but broader gauges of prices are surging. For example, the Cleveland Fed publishes a “trimmed mean” of inflation that excludes the biggest outlier components. And this measure – which is particularly popular with economists – jumped to its highest level in three decades last month.

Earlier this year, central banks put forward another argument: that the high inflation numbers are distorted because of the “base effect”, meaning the low level of prices last year (due to pandemic shutdowns) led to elevated year-on-year inflation readings. And so they proposed looking at inflation measured over 24 months instead. But not only has this measure of inflation steadily crept up over the past five months, it’s also just hit its highest level since the global financial crisis. So it seems no matter how you dissect it, inflation is looking increasingly like it’s here to stay…

Takeaways 

1. Central banks have a tricky decision to make.  
At least a tight labor market has got wages rising – problem is, they’re not increasing fast enough to keep up with inflation. That means employees’ real wages – that is, their earnings adjusted for inflation – are actually declining, denting people’s spending power. That’s bad news for most developed countries: consumer spending is by far the largest driver of their economies, so an inflation-driven dent in spending can lead to weaker economic growth. That means central banks have a conundrum on their hands: they should implement economy-boosting measures when growth is falling, but have to withdraw them when inflation is running too hot.

2. You can adjust your portfolio to survive this environment.  
Traditional bonds aren’t faring too well: their fixed, future payments are worth less when the prices of goods and services tick higher. So inflation-linked bonds, whose principal and interest payments rise and fall with the rate of inflation, could be a smarter investment. And if central banks are forced to raise interest rates to cool down inflation, that could cause value stocks to outperform expensive-looking growth stocks. That’s because the latter promise tasty earnings in the future, but higher interest rates reduce the present-day value of those future earnings. There’s also gold – it’s traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge – and cryptocurrencies, which are starting to be viewed by some investors as a potential hedge for times like this.

Also On Our Radar 

Peloton shares tanked 35% last Friday after the at-home exercise equipment maker cut its revenue and subscriber forecasts. Demand is down now that gym-goers can, you know, go back to gyms, and investors are getting worried that other pandemic-boosted stocks might start coming back down to earth now that lockdowns seem to be behind us.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}","Finance","d5e4f8a2"

# Today’s Top News  

  * Israeli forces pounded central Gaza by land, sea and air and Palestinian authorities reported dozens more deaths, with the U.N. health agency saying thousands of people were trying to flee the fighting.
  * US President Joe Biden hoped to present a firm response to Yemen's Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping by launching a new maritime force, but a week after its launch many allies don't want to be associated with it.
  * North Korea leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the military, munitions industry and nuclear weapons sector to accelerate war preparations to counter what he called unprecedented confrontational moves by the US, state media said.
  * A rapper who attended a celebrity party with only a sock to hide his modesty has been jailed for 15 days, sponsors of some of Russia's best known entertainers have torn up their contracts, and President Vladimir Putin is reported to be unamused. Here's how a semi-naked party sparked a backlash in a country at war.

# The Year in Review  

649 photographers, 125 countries, 1.3 million photos: Click on the image for a selection of our photos of the year. Above, migrants on their journey to the US border. REUTERS/Gustavo Graf  

  * Israel and Hamas at war: The last three months of 2023 have been marked by a conflict in the Middle East that has cost thousands of lives, left families across Israel and Gaza and further afield anxious or grieving, and destroyed homes and livelihoods. See a selection of Reuters photographs that tell the grim story of the first weeks of the war. 
  * In Ukraine, 22 months into the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two, fighting rages with no end in sight and neither side has landed a telling blow on the battlefield. The country is preparing for a long war.
  * Electric vehicles took a detour: Heading into 2023, automakers were gearing up to invest $1.2 trillion by 2030 to move EVs from niche products to mass-market models. As the year closes, legacy automakers as well as Tesla, Rivian and others are throttling back investments and reworking product strategies. For more on the industry, sign up for the Auto File newsletter. 
  * Sustainable funds faced a sharp slowdown in demand globally in 2023 amid political controversy and concerns about “greenwashing,” even as many outperformed the broader market when the recovery of technology-related stocks bolstered their returns. Sign up for the Sustainable Finance newsletter. 
  * In the world of sports, Spain's brilliant victory at the Women's World Cup was almost immediately overshadowed by a controversial kiss which proved that despite a great deal of progress in the women's game more structural change is needed. We also look at how sporting platforms have turned into lightning rods for social activism. 
  * How to sum up the most important news of the year? The obvious answer in 2023 is to use Artificial Intelligence. Reuters Executive Editor Simon Robinson asked ChatGPT and Bard to do the job for him. Their responses show AI’s power, but also the ways it still falls short, in this case both in terms of Reuters editorial standards and when compared to human editors.

# The Year Ahead

  * The governance of more than a quarter of the world's population will be at stake in elections next year, including in Taiwan, Russia, India and the United States. For those who worry that authoritarian rulers are firmly in the ascendant over more liberal democrats, there is likely to be much to fret about. 
  * Speaking of the US elections, here are four reasons why Donald Trump could win again. And more than a year after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn its Roe v. Wade ruling, abortion is bedeviling the Republican presidential candidates. This is how it could impact the elections. 
  * Expect more turbulence in US-China relations. Joe Biden and Xi Jinping face no shortage of problems that could cause a stumble in the new year. Read this analysis by US Foreign Policy Editor Don Durfee and Chief China Correspondent Antoni Slodkowski.
  * Interest rates: Is the Big Ease coming? A major game of chicken is underway as market actors have set expectations for far more policy easing than central bankers are likely to be willing to provide. Here's how 2024 could see the end of the past year's aggressive rate hikes. And looking at the US dollar, a faster pace of rate cuts could accelerate the currency's decline. For more, you can also listen to our economics correspondents on a special episode of Reuters World News. 
  * Can China get its economic miracle back on track? The country's disappointing post-COVID recovery has raised doubts about the foundations of its decades of stunning growth and presented Beijing with a tough choice for 2024 and beyond: Take on more debt or grow less. 
  * The oil and gas industry went on a $250 billion buying spree in 2023, taking advantage of companies' high stock prices to secure lower-cost reserves and prepare for the next upheaval in the industry. More transactions are on the horizon. 
  * The International Olympic Committee hopes the 2024 Paris Games will be the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" after two COVID-hit Olympics but organizers face major security challenges before a unique opening ceremony on July 26. Keeping athletes and spectators safe is a top priority.

"5 things to know for Feb. 13, 2025","CNN 5 Things","February 13, 2025","(CNN) — Severe winter weather is disrupting travel and commutes across the US, with data showing thousands of recent flight cancellations and delays. Millions of people on the West Coast are currently under alerts for flooding rainfall, while snow and ice continue to pound several central and eastern states.

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.

## 1. Federal firings

Scores of firings have begun at federal agencies, with terminations of probationary employees underway at the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration, sources told CNN. The moves mark the first from the Trump administration as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency aims to dramatically shrink the federal workforce and pull back on government spending. Until now, federal employees across all US agencies had only been placed on paid administrative leave. The full scope of the firings remains unclear, though it has impacted at least dozens of workers.

## 2. Trump-Putin call

President Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after he held a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The two leaders discussed the future of the conflict and “agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,” Trump said. His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also reaffirmed that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration focuses on securing US borders and deterring war with China.

## 3. Inflation

Despite promises from President Trump to bring prices down, many common goods and services in the US got more expensive last month. Inflation jumped to 3% — its highest rate since June of last year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase was driven by many factors, including the rising costs of energy and food. That’s particularly true of eggs, which have seen prices soar and widespread shortages due to avian flu. Egg prices, which are up 53% year-over-year, shot up more than 15% from December to January.

## 4. Homelessness

City and state officials in parts of the US are uncertain how to respond to a surge in homelessness and encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in parks. Meanwhile, people who live in those encampments and advocacy groups say they are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing. This week, the city council in Fremont, California, voted to criminalize “aiding” and “abetting” homeless camps — an unusual move that advocates say could stifle help for people who need it. The new policy comes about seven months after the Supreme Court ruled that ticketing homeless people does not constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.”

## 5. Taiwan explosion

A blast inside a shopping mall in Taiwan earlier today killed at least five people and injured several others, according to local officials. Dramatic videos of the explosion in the city of Taichung, on the island’s west coast, showed debris and large panels of a building’s exterior blown out as a loud bang is heard. Footage shot by bystanders of the aftermath showed the street below littered with debris as hundreds evacuated the area. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te urged authorities to investigate the cause of the accident.

"NBA All-30: Everybody Plays","The Sportsletter","February 13, 2025","Good Morning!

We’ve got bargain basketball. All 30 NBA teams were in action on the same night — a rarity that only occurs a few times a year. Four guys went for 40-plus (KAT, Kyrie Irving, Jordan Poole and Jamal Murray). That’s one short of the NBA record for the most 40-pieces in one day.

There were also goals aplenty in the NHL’s 4 Nations showdown and the Champions League. Another MLB free agent is off the board, too.

Letter Rip!

All-30: NBA for Everybody

Jamal Murray’s 55 Points, Kyrie Irving’s 3-Point Barrage, Knicks-Hawks Chaos & More From an All-30 Night in the NBA

Fifteen games in one night? Yes, please. The perfect way to transition into NBA All-Star Weekend was an all-30 night of NBA action. Fifteen games featuring every team meant six-plus hours of hoops highlights across the country. There were four 40-point scorers; just one short of the NBA record for most in one night. Here are the top stories from a special evening in the Association:

Jamal Murray Notches Career-High 55 — Have a night, Mr. Murray! The Nuggets’ star guard hung a career-high 55 on the Blazers in a win (132-121). Murray hit seven 3s (20-for-36 FG). It’s his fourth career 50-point game.

Kyrie Irving Catches Fire From 3 — The short-handed Mavericks welcomed the Warriors to Dallas, and it was the Kyrie Irving show in the second half. Kyrie (42 points) went 7-for-10 from 3, including a stretch of four straight in the 4th quarter. Dallas won (111-107).

Knicks-Hawks Classic at MSG — The Hawks and Knicks battled into the night at MSG with one of the most exciting finishes of the season. All the stars showed out — Karl-Anthony Towns (44 pts), Jalen Brunson (36 pts), Trae Young (38 pts). Atlanta rallied in the 4th, but Brunson hit the game-winner with 11 seconds left in OT (Knicks win, 149-148, OT).

Bronny’s New Career-High — The Lakers fell to the Jazz in an awkward night for L.A. (131-119) where Luka Doncic (16 pts) and LeBron James (18 pts) failed to crack 20. One silver lining was Bronny James’ career-high 9 points (Two 3s) in just eight minutes. 

Kevin Durant’s 30K Encore — KD hit the 30,000-point milestone earlier in the week. He followed it up with 37 last night, but the Suns are in rough shape. Phoenix lost to the Rockets (119-111), and they’ve dropped six of their last seven.

NBA All-30 Highlights: Celtics def. Spurs (116-103) | Magic def. Hornets (102-86) | Pacers def. Wizards (134-130, OT) | Nets def. 76ers (100-96) | Cavaliers def. Raptors (131-108) | Pistons def. Bulls (128-110) | Bucks def. T-Wolves (103-101) | Kings def. Pelicans (119-111) | Thunder def. Heat (115-101) | Clippers def. Grizzlies (128-114) | Jazz def. Lakers (131-119) | Rockets def. Suns (119-111) | Nuggets def. Blazers (132-121) | Mavericks def. Warriors (111-107) | Knicks def. Hawks (149-148, OT)

4 Nations: 1-And-Oh, Canada

Sidney Crosby (3 Assists), Mitch Marner (OT Winner) Lift Canada Over Sweden (4-3, OT) in 4 Nations Opener

We’re skating in the Great White North. Canada and Sweden dropped the puck on the NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off last night with a thrilling start. The Canadians might have too much firepower for anybody in this thing. Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid is a front line force that might break the brains of hockey fans. Sid the Kid (3 assists) was dishing dimes all night, and Mitch Marner fired the top-shelf winner 6:06 into OT on a breakaway (4-3, OT). That’s 1-and-Oh, Canada.

Watch: Canada def. Sweden (4-3, OT)

Next Game (Tonight): USA vs. Finland (8:00 pm, ESPN)

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

UCL KOs: Day 2 Drama

Bayern Survive Celtic Rally, But Italian Sides Milan & Atalanta Tumble

Kicking contests were at it again. The UEFA Champions League produced four one-goal matches on Wednesday, which should make next week very interesting. Bayern hung on to beat Celtic (2-1) thanks to a beaut from Harry Kane. Feyenoord scooped a win over Milan (1-0) thanks a super early goal (3rd minute) that proved to be enough. Benfica and Club Brugge were also narrow winners, and it’s looking like a lot of narrow aggregate scorelines to bring the drama in next week’s second legs. Six of the eight KO Playoffs are separated by one goal entering next week. More fun ahead.

Champions League Highlights: Bayern def. Celtic (2-1) | Club Brugge def. Atalanta (2-1) | Feyenoord def. Milan (1-0) | Benfica def. Monaco (1-0) | The Champions League Bracket

Boston Swings for Bregman

Red Sox Sign Two-Time World Series Champ Alex Bregman to 3-Year, $120 Million Deal

The biggest remaining free agent in baseball is now off the market. The Boston Red Sox signed 3B Alex Bregman to a 3-year, $120 million deal yesterday. The connection between Bregman and Red Sox manager Alex Cora stems back to their days together in Houston. The two-time All-Star won two titles and spent all nine seasons with the Astros, but he’s heading to the northeast before his 31st birthday.

Bregman hit .260 with 26 HRs and 75 RBIs in 2024, so he’s got some juice left.
